Slayer headlined.
I don't recall much of anything that night before Slayer.
They totally annihilated.
Clearly, no other band mattered that night at the Ritz.
The dog affair tells us the Nazis were not only criminals and mass murderers, they were silly as hell.
There are very few things you can laugh about because what they did was so monstrous.
But there were two or three dozen people discussing the affair of the dog rather than preparing for the invasion of the Soviet Union.
They were crazy.
Particularly for a period piece, film gives the audience a definite sense of period and quality.
And because of the story’s epic nature, widescreen clearly made the most sense.
Widescreen means a big film, an epic tale – in this case an epic tale of human endurance.
In 1993 I accepted the fact that an ordinary band line-up was too narrow for me and I decided to start a project, later named Arcana.
It was based on the ideas that had been haunting me for a very long time, the ideas of creating medieval inspired music, or perhaps I should say based on the romantic image we all have about the middle ages, and doing that through a very personal point of view...
In fact, we often find ourselves urging governments to use their coercive power more assertively to protect civilians.
We want to see Joseph Kony and others responsible for atrocities – whether they are abusive leaders in countries like Sudan, or terrorists who kill civilians, brought to justice.
The celebrated Rabbit-woman of Godalmin was commited to Guildford Gaol for receiving stolen goods.
As yet, the necessity for rapid and convenient evaluation of integrals has not been eliminated by computers.
Rock and roll has always been this joy, this certain happiness that is in its way the most beautiful thing in life.
But rock is also about hardness and coldness and being alone ...
I finally got to the place where I realized life had paradoxes, a lot of them, and you’ve got to live with them.
There is a new Opera now in Rehearsal at the Theatre in the Hay-Market, a Part of which is reserv’d for one Mrs. Cotsona, an extraordinary Italian Lady, who is expected daily from Italy.
It is said, she has a much finer Voice and more accurate Judgment, than any of her Country Women who have performed on the English Stage.
In besieged Libyan city of Misrata.
Indiscriminate shelling by Qaddafi forces.
No sign of NATO.
If random creatures and meaningless hallways are your thing, you'll love Dungeon Hack -- the rest of us like at least a little story to justify our monster butchery.
I turn up in Los Angeles every now and then, so I can get some big money films in order to finance my smaller money films.
I was at the opera of Alexander was infinitely better than any Italian opera; but it vexed me to hear some favourite songs mangled
There are no known clinical side effects specifically arising from the use of hyperflexion, however there are serious concerns for a horse's well-being if the technique is not practiced correctly.
The FEI condemns hyperflexion in any equestrian sport as an example of mental abuse.
The FEI states that it does not support the practice.
Sathya Sai Baba said in this discourse of 9 September 60 (Chapter 31 of Sathya Sai Speaks volume 1): I will be in this mortal human form for 59 years more .
Tyranny is the combination of brutality, poverty, instability, corruption, and suffering, forged under the rule of despots and despotic systems.
People living in nations such as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), Iran, Syria, Cuba, Belarus, Burma, and Zimbabwe know firsthand the meaning of tyranny; it is the bleak reality they endure every day.
Prediction is not just one of the things your brain does.
It is the primary function of the neocortex, and the foundation of intelligence.
Enclosed or semi-enclosed chamber(s), usually relatively permanent or re-usable and non-portable, to hold ceramic materials during firing and to generate, contain, and channel heat for that purpose
Mingaud quietly advanced, took up and struck the white ball, which, after contact with the red, recoiled upon him.
Affecting extreme horror, he dropped the cue, and summoned the waiter, to whom he explained that when he had pushed a ball forward it ran backwards.
The spectators were incredulous, and, in reply to their entreaties, Mingaud attempted another stroke, but with the same result.
The balls were seized and condemned as ‚tormented by a devil‘,…
Elbow’s music is usually about the past, or about how our pasts inform our present, the heavy weight of our lives.
And on Leaders Of The Free World, even more so than before, it’s about missed connections, regrets, imagined affairs, wishful thinking.
I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, ‘They’re looting.’
You see a white family, it says, ‘They’re looking for food.’ And, you know, it’s been five days because most of the people are black. the Red Cross is doing everything they can.
We already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting another way – and they’ve given them permission to go down and shoot us!
We are gathered here from all Albanian lands.
We feel proud for you, commander, and today we promise that we will make everything possible to turn the national unification dream to reality, as the most noble and most European dream of this country.
A decade of strife between labor and industry culminated here in a confrontation that resulted in the tragic death of both workers and policemen.
On May 4, 1886, spectators at a labor rally had gathered around the mouth of Crane’s Alley.
A contingent of police approaching on DesPlaines Street were met by a bomb thrown from just south of the alley.
The resultant trial of eight activists gained worldwide attention for the labor movement, and initiated the tradition of ‘May Day’ labor rallies in many cities.
We are credibly inform’d that one Day last Week Mr. H–d–l, Director-General of the Opera-House, sent a Message to Signior Senesino, the famous Italian Singer, acquainting Him that He had no farther Occasion for his Service; and that Senesino reply’d the next Day by a Letter, containing a full Resignation of all his Parts in the Opera, which He had perform’d for many Years with great Applause.
It should be obvious to the most casual and unsophisticated observer by volatility arguments like those made here that the efficient markets model must be wrong ...
The failure of the efficient markets model is thus so dramatic that it would seem impossible to attribute the failure to such things as data errors, price index problems, or changes in tax law.
In order to demonstrate to the enemy in Germany generally the overwhelming superiority of the Allied Air Forces in this theatre … the intention is to apply within the shortest practical period the maximum effort of the Royal Air Force Bomber Command and the 8th United States Bomber Command against objectives in the densely populated Ruhr.

The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the Famine.
Come all’ urto, is an admirable composition, with a fine solo part, originally designed for Caporale’s violoncello.
This straightforward live souvenir combines songs from Blow by Blow and Wired, plus a few other things, and while it features typically fiery playing from Beck, the backup is a bit too heavy-handed and the occasional vocals (by Hammer and drummer Tony Smith) are embarrassing.
Conny loved and understood British psychedelic and German electronic music.
These were two areas we were keen to merge.
No-one else really understood and encompassed all this as fully as Conny did at that time.
( ) If less than 40% of the electorate vote in the referendum, the result shall not be binding.
The pleasure of experiencing Haydn and van Swieten’s Die Schöpfung lies less in the inevitable trajectory of the plot – we all know the story, and it contains no real sense of conflict – than in the wide-eyed wonder with which the composer visits its familiar contours.
A childlike quality pervades the work, as if Haydn were relating the narrative to young listeners who had never heard it before.
When a syllable beginning with a, e, or o appears non-initially in a polysyllabic word, it is preceded by an apostrophe.
Actually Dresden was a mass of munitions works, an intact government centre, and a key transportation point to the East.
It is now none of these things.
The curse of commercialism is the ruin of sport, and the degeneracy of motor racing as a sport is due to the financial issues now involved.
When white turns to red / In the not too distant days / Will force and misery / Be the life you have to lead?
Studer four-track machine.
I only had, however, one mike, and I worked without VU meters or a mixer, which meant that everything had to be listened to first for distortion, etc, then recorded.
So the answer – Studer, one mike, and nerve.
But I just needed to find out if people would think this album sucked or not.
I need closure.
Spike Lee’s Malcolm X is one of the great screen biographies, celebrating the whole sweep of an American life that began in sorrow and bottomed out on the streets and in prison before its hero reinvented himself.
Watching the film, I understood more clearly how we do have the power to change our own lives, how fate doesn’t deal all of the cards.
The film is inspirational and educational – and it is also entertaining, as movies must be before they can be anything else.
Spike Lee is not only one of the best filmmakers in America, but one of the most crucially important, because his films address the central subject of race.
He doesn’t use sentimentality or political cliches, but shows how his characters live, and why.
Broadly defined, GAP applies available knowledge to addressing environmental, economic and social sustainability for on-farm production and post-production processes resulting in safe and healthy food and non-food agricultural products.
Exposure of bystanders to the listed ingredients, let alone the contaminants, does not warrant a concern as the exposure is likely to be orders of magnitude lower than exposure experienced by vapers

Our Goal: To educate the public about climate science and through them bring pressure to bear on governments to engage in public debates on the scientific merits of the hypothesis of human induced global warming and the various policies that intend to address the issue.
On the base of the obtained results and on ARPA data about urban pollution, we can conclude by saying that could be more unhealty to breath air in big cities compared to staying in the same room with someone who is vaping.
While the state’s case may not be ironclad, most reasonable jurors would again vote to convict Mr Davis of Officer MacPhail’s murder.
A federal court simply cannot interpose itself and set aside the jury verdict in this case absent a truly persuasive showing of innocence.
… if the kids catch you and should ask, tell them Custer and the maiden are just dancing.
The improved musket has been completed, and tried, with very satisfactory results.
The principal points of its difference from the present service musket are the use of two lugs instead of one for holding the bolt against the rearward pressure of the powder, with resulting increase of strength sufficient to enable a velocity of 2300 feet per second to be obtained;
Bill told me once, when discussing eq’s "there is no right or wrong when it comes to recording, turn the knobs until it sounds right to your ear."
Those words I live by till this day.
The music videos of Tijuana NO! urge us to develop a new grammar of globalization that disarticulates dominant ideology form technical systems of material production, one that properly accounts for the way musicians and videomakers are manipulating mass media against their will as modes of emergent citizenship and tools for social change, while denouncing and dismantling the prescribed models of citizenship and the structures of racism, imperialism, and colonialism that these tools are packaged in.
I like to give electronic instruments life.
I like to express the soul of the machine, rather than be a slave to it.
I’d like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves and I hope we passed the audition.
I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice... they deserve to be completely and publicly exonerated.
Suppose a white man should come to me and say „Joseph, I like your horses, and I want to buy them“. I say to him, „No, my horses suit me well, I will not sell them.“ Then he goes to my neighbor, and says to him: „Joseph has some good horses.
I want to buy them, but he refuses to sell.“ My neighbor answers, „Pay me the money, and I will sell you Joseph’s horses.“ The white man returns to me, and says, „Joseph, I have bought your horses, and you must let me have them.“ If we sold our lands to the Government, this is the way they were bought

Many filmmakers forget how important geography is to a story.
I chose Bodega Bay because I wanted an isolated group of people who lived near an articulate community.
Bodega Bay is a place where sophisticated San Franciscans drive to spend the weekend.
The location provided the combination we wanted.
Let's hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters. :o)
I went to a meeting of the members of the Royal Academy of Musick: where we agreed to prosecute the subscribers who have not yet paid; also to permit Hydeger and Hendle to carry on operas without disturbance for 5 years and to lend them for that time our scenes, machines, clothes, instruments, furniture, etc.
It all past off in a great hurry, and there was not above 20 there.
Hendel thought, encouraged by the Princess Royal, it had merit enough to deserve a guinea, and the first time it was performed at that price there was but a 120 people in the House.
The subscribers being refused unless they would pay a guinea, they, insisting upon the right of their silver tickets, forced into the House, and carried their point.
Reed himself has even managed to rekindle his intense, individualistic guitar playing of the late Sixties.
Better yet, he has shelved his recent FM-DJ vocal style in favor of confident, expressive singing.

The interface is remarkably easy to use, the initial track list is solid and the motion-sensitive light-up microphones are outstanding.
Like a jewel in a brooch, the Roman-Dutch law in South Africa today glitters in a setting that was made in England.
Even if it were true (which it is not) that the whole of South African private and commercial law had remained pure Roman-Dutch law, the South African legal system as a whole would still be a hybrid one, in which civil- and common-law elements jostle each other.
The granule of reuse is the granule of release.
Only components that are released through a tracking system can be effectively reused.
This granule is the package.
No soldier in this field has fought more courageously, more heroically than Medgar Evers.
Should any party attempt to abolish social security and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history.
There is a tiny splinter group of course, that believes you can do these things … Their number is negligible and they are stupid.

"Tuatha Na Gael" is a jewel among the fine albums the band has created.
It is a perfect representative of their personal style and has also a face of its own.
This merry album is enjoyable for every fan of Cruachan and a fine experience for any person who likes folk metal all in all.
Underscore is a utility-belt library… the tie to go along with jQuery’s tux, and Backbone.js’s suspenders.
There’s nothing funny about World Peace.
Social Justice never killed at the Comedy Store.
If we ever attain a worldwide consciousness of peace and justice, I’ll be happily out of a job.
But as long as there’s poverty, war, bigotry, ignorance, greed, lust and paranoia, I’ve got a career.
Both bands are the same.
The one where Chester sings and writes is Dead By Sunrise, but when I sing, and Amir and I are the primary writers, it becomes Julien-K and it's more electro and much darker...Julien-K and Dead by Sunrise are basically a creative collective, we're sort of a Warhol-style factory in that sense Dead by Sunrise is Chester's Julien-K if that makes any sense.
Let us pray here in the Old North Church tonight that those who follow 100 years or 200 years from now may look back at us and say: We were a society which combined reason with liberty and hope with freedom.
May it be said above all: We kept the faith, freedom flourished, liberty lived.
These are the abiding principles of our past and the greatest promise of our future.
Xena ushered in the golden age of lesbian subtext.
For six seasons between 1995 and 2001, the show’s writers danced around the issue of the Warrior Princess’ relationship with Gabrielle.
Perpetual innuendo, running jokes and subtle references to Xena and Gabby’s sexuality permeated the plot and dialogue.
And though Lucy Lawless is on record as calling the couple ‘married,’ the show’s creative team never offered up a definitive answer about their relationship.

The algorithms and methodologies underlying the project rely primarily on previously available, usually public, information sources.
These include monitoring cameras, public Web pages, etc. The research covered by the INDECT grant, will not consider processing of highly sensitive material, such as telephone intercept, VoIP, etc.
Dedicated to arranger Gil Evans, the music is greatly influenced by his style..This was the first of several instances in which Miles Davis, in the twilight of his life, returned to his roots.
he shark in an updated Jaws could not be the villain; it would have to be written as the victim, for, worldwide, sharks are much more the oppressed than the oppressors.
There's a very fine line between underacting and not acting at all.
And not acting is what a lot of actors are guilty of.
It amazes me how some of these little numbers with dreamy looks and a dead pan are getting away with it.

The collaboration with Kerbal Space Program can help drive interest by future explorers in next-generation technology development and deep space exploration.
Having an element of the experience based in the reality of NASA’s exploration initiatives empower players to manage their own space program while getting valuable insight into the reality of studying asteroids as a next step in getting to Mars.
Public Enemy's mean and minimalist rap is marked by an absolute absence of melody - the scary sound is just a throbbing pulse, hard drums and a designed-to-irritate electronic whine, like a dentist's drill or a persistent mosquito.
she was short and squat, with a doughy cross face, but fine complexion; was not a good actress; dressed ill; and was silly and fantastical.
And yet on her appearing in this opera, in a brown silk gown, trimmed with silver, with the vulgarity and indecorum of which all the old ladies were much scandalised, the young adopted it as a fashion, so universally, that it seemed a national uniform for youth and beauty.
Here lie three bones of foreign cars.

Category II protected areas are large natural or near natural areas set aside to protect large-scale ecological processes, along with the complement of species and ecosystems characteristic of the area, which also provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible, spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational, and visitor opportunities.
For material, we obviously went right down to our blues roots.
I still had plenty of Yardbirds riffs left over.
On the first LP I was still heavily influenced by the earlier days.
I think it tells a bit, too.
The album was made in three weeks.
It was obvious that somebody had to take the lead, otherwise we’d have all sat around jamming and doing nothing for six months.
But after that, on the second LP, you can hear the real group identity coming together.
I do not want to suggest anything of the kind.
I know Oppenheimer as an intellectually most alert and a very complicated person, and I think it would be presumptuous and wrong on my part if I would try in any way to analyze his motives.
But I have always assumed, and I now assume that he is loyal to the United States.
I believe this, and I shall believe it until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.
Every project must commit to delivery on a few hard times and fast dates.
This is actually fortunate because it is about the only way to get out of work that is going poorly.
I can say that raw feelings make a good sound.
Because we are not machine. We could shed blood, could vomit and have feeling of hate.
I wanted to express the mental instability and mental cruelty which a girl has.
Now we are holding up pride, hate and life in the front.
We are not wearing that dress.
In a case of self-defence, where self-defence or the prevention of crime is concerned, if the jury came to the conclusion that the defendant believed, or may have believed, that he was being attacked or that a crime was being committed, and that force was necessary to protect himself or to prevent the crime, then the prosecution have not proved their case.
If however the defendant’s alleged belief was mistaken and if the mistake was an unreasonable one, that may be a peaceful reason for coming to the conclusion that the belief was not honestly held and should be rejected.
Even if the jury come to the conclusion that the mistake was an unreasonable one, if the defendant may genuinely have been labouring under it, he is entitled to rely upon it.
Yin and Yang are terms used to express a contrastive relationship that obtains between two or more things.
But who would have thought the Infection should reach the Hay-market and inspire Two Singing Ladies to pull each other’s Coiffs for it is certainly an apparent Shame that two such well bred Ladies should call Bitch and Whore, should scold and fight like any Billingsgates.
zero – a poem that should have never been written – and a ten – a poem that causes a mutual, simultaneous orgasm throughout the audience.
The American flag, then, throughout more than 200 years of our history, has come to be the visible symbol embodying our Nation.
It does not represent the views of any particular political party, and it does not represent any particular political philosophy.
The flag is not simply another ‘idea’ or ‘point of view’ competing for recognition in the marketplace of ideas.
Millions and millions of Americans regard it with an almost mystical reverence regardless of what sort of social, political, or philosophical beliefs they may have.
I cannot agree that the First Amendment invalidates the Act of Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50 States, which make criminal the public burning of the flag.
A protected area is a clearly defined geographical space, recognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values.
There is no need to fear that such a way of arranging society will lead to undesireable results.
Science itself uses the method of ballot, discussion, vote, though without a clear grasp of its mechanism, and in a heavily biased way.
But the rationality of our beliefs will certainly be considerably increased.

The Catholic Encyclopedia, as its name implies, proposes to give its readers full and authoritative information on the entire cycle of Catholic interests, action and doctrine.
What the Church teaches and has taught; what she has done and is still doing for the highest welfare of mankind; her methods, past and present; her struggles, her triumphs, and the achievements of her members, not only for her own immediate benefit, but for the broadening and deepening of all true science, literature and art – all come within the scope of the Catholic Encyclopedia.

Packages that are maximally stable should be maximally abstract.
Instable packages should be concrete.
The abstraction of a package should be in proportion to its stability.
The purposes of the Sierra Club are to explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the earth; to practice and promote the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; to educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to use all lawful means to carry out these objectives.

Here lives that execrable white-faced, rotten catamite, who joined with his own mother to consummate the murder of an unfortunate gentleman who had saved his life, and whom, in return, he poisoned five times with common arsenic, which, it is probable, he will never recover the bloody effects of.

Tell General Howard I know his heart.
What he told me before – I have it in my heart.
I am tired of fighting.
Our chiefs are killed.
It is cold, and we have no blankets.
The little children are freezing to death.
My people – some of them - have run away to the hills, and have no blankets, no food.
No one knows where they are - perhaps freezing to death.
I want to have time to look for my children, and to see how many of them I can find; maybe I shall find them among the dead.
Hear me, my chiefs; my heart is sick and sad.
From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever.
The living culture of Central Europe was cut in the '30s, and all the intellectuals went to the U.S. or to France, or they were eliminated.
We take back that culture of the '30s at the point where it was left, and this on a spiritual level .
Action expands to fill the void created by human failure.
Maximum the Hormone’s Bu Ikikaesu sounds like an attempt to adapt the music of Slipknot to the strict confines of the Japanese pop music business.
We cannot afford to give ourselves moral airs when our most enterprising neighbor humanely and judiciously liquidates a handful of exploiters and speculators to make the world safe for honest men.
At the time, it should be remembered, there was almost no competition at all.
Writing music for games was considered to be at the artistic level of, say, writing the tones that tell the McDonalds’ workers that the french fries are ready.
I Thought Elite could never be beaten as the greatest ever space game, but after playing Space Rogue for hours on end I've changed my mind.

In June 1811 a curiose instrument called a Pan Harmonicon was brought to Boston.
It was invented by Maelzel, whose name is usually linked with the Metronome.
William Goodrich was employed to set up and exhibit the Pan Harmonicon in New York and other cities.
He traveled with the instrument from September 1811 until June 1812.
Shane MacGowan never lets go of it for a second: he tests the flavor of each word before spitting it out.
Rappers talk about, oh I buy this and I buy that, and I spend this much money and I make it rain, and this type of champagne and painting the club, and this is the kind of record that's the exact opposite.
It’s the polar opposite of it.
It’s kind of standing for like let’s save some money, let’s keep some money away, let's spend as little as possible and look as fresh as possible at the same time.
Interviewer: Did you feel damaged as a child, or was yours a relatively normal childhood?
Depp: Normal?
I wouldn’t go that far.
Interviewer: Then how was it abnormal?
Depp: It was strange, though then again, it was normal to us.
It wasn’t until I started going to other kid’s houses and hanging out, having dinner, seeing what a family is supposed to do that I saw that we weren’t normal.
Wild Horses is one of the Rolling Stones’ most beautiful ballads, and one of the most worthwhile country-influenced rock songs ever done by a major rock band… It’s a rock song, and more important, a Rolling Stones song, with typically salacious, drawling Mick Jagger vocals… But within that minority of heartfelt, romantic originals, Wild Horses is certainly one of the Stones’ best, most sincere efforts.
This will be the easiest war. . . .
We will have to fight only four days a week.
The Arabs won't fight on Friday, the Jews on Saturday and Dobbie certainly won't on Sunday.
Brilliant is a bitter sweet comment on pop culture.
It’s about the other side of fame and success, a song about the bright young things that ignore the consequences of fame with the ensuing burn out rate.
In a way it should read Brilliant with a question mark.
We hear that several Persons have been sent to Italy from the two Theatres, to engage some additional Voices, for the carrying on of Operas for the ensuing Season, and that Sig. Dominichino, one of the best Singers now in Italy, is engaged by Mr. Handel, and is expected over in a short time.
This theory is wrong on two counts: French haute cuisine did not appear until a century later and then showed little Italian influence; and there is no evidence that Catherine's cooks had any impact on French cooking in the early sixteenth century.
Indeed, French sixteenth-century cooking was very conservative and in general continued the medieval traditions.“
for whereas of his earlier operas, that is to say, those composed by him between the years 1710 and 1728, the merits are so great, that few are able to say which is to be preferred ; those composed after that period have so little to recommend them In the former class are Radamistus in either of which scarcely an indifferent air occurs
De democracia não tinha nada.

Rudimental may not have delivered a game-changer, but when your sound is still this fresh, why bother?
Why should the law refuse its protection to any sensitive being?
The time will come when humanity will extend its mantle over everything which breathes.
It is no exaggeration to say that during the past thirty years no geographical expedition of any consequence has been undertaken in our own or, I believe I might say, in any other country, without some previous reference to him for advice and suggestion, often entailing laborious research and correspondence.
He’s only gone crazy once.
Decided to stay.
No part of Groote Eylandt was in sight; but an island of considerable extent and elevation, not noticed in the old chart, lay six or seven miles to the E. N. E.; and I have called it Bickerton's Island, in compliment to admiral Sir Richard Bickerton.
In passing the south side of Bickerton's Island, we observed in it a deep bight or bay which would afford shelter in the north-west monsoon, if there be depth sufficient for a ship; and the hills at the back being high and woody, there was a probability of its receiving a stream of fresh water.
The country round the entrance of the bight, had the appearance of being sandy and sterile.
The clothes in those scenes could not be hanging down because, without gravity, they would be floating.
We had to do things like wire shoelaces to make sure they were standing straight out and tack down the men’s ties so they didn’t flop around at random.
Likeable Ali shows that the globalised American thug life is ridiculously inappropriate to the life of marginal young Brits.
"... when I described how they flew, I said that they flew like they take a saucer and throw it across the water.
Most of the newspapers misunderstood and misquoted that too.
They said that I said that they were saucer-like; I said that they flew in a saucer-like fashion."
I remember how the Eton men howled at the Rugby men for handling the ball.
So it was agreed that two men should be chosen to represent each of the public schools, and two who were not public school men, for the 'Varsity.
G. Salt and myself were chosen for the 'Varsity. (… ) We met in my rooms after Hall, which in those days was at 4.pm.; anticipating a long meeting, I cleared the tables and provided pens, ink and paper. (… ) Every man brought a copy of his school rules, or knew them by heart, and our progress in framing new rules was slow. (… ) The new rules were printed as the "Cambridge Rules", copies were distributed and pasted up on Parker's Piece, and very satisfactorily they worked, for it is right to add that they were loyally kept, and I never heard of any public school man who gave up playing from not liking the rules. (… ) Well Sir, years afterwards someone took these rules, still in force at Cambridge, and with a very few alterations they became the Association Rules.

Magicians and wizards are not going to be tossing fireballs around, flying through the air, teleporting, or anything like that.
That sort of thing simply isn’t appropriate for LOTR; it violates the conventions of the setting and the ’feel‘ of Tolkien’s works.
At first I couldn’t sleep, then I couldn’t eat.
I felt hopeless and I just couldn’t cope and then I just lost all perspective on things.
You know, you become crazy.
I had done a story for 60 Minutes on depression but I had no idea that I was now experiencing it.
Finally, I collapsed and just went to bed
Standing in the dark / Watching you glow / Lifting a receiver / Nobody I know
I wanted the video to capture the ever-changing energy and emotion of the song through real human feelings … It takes you on a journey through love, loss, contentment and anxiety.
Musically, the chord progression I wrote captured the feeling and tension, unpredictability and the unknown.
The video portrays this through a relationship between a man (human) and woman (alien) and the dynamics/excitement between the two of them.
We did some rather audacious things.
We shot on top of a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so we could get the shots finished.
We knew we couldn't be there long.
All we had to do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of there.
And we certainly couldn't pay for it.
In addition, some part of the energy set free by the bomb goes to produce radioactive substances, and these will emit very powerful and dangerous radiations.
The effect of these radiations is greatest immediately after the explosion, but it decays only gradually and even for days after the explosion any person entering the affected area will be killed.'Some of this radioactivity will be carried along with the wind and will spread the contamination; several miles downwind this may kill people.
One concept in Tantra Vajrayana is that referred to by Asahara as poa, in which the spirits of the dead are transferred to a higher status through secret rites based on the power of the guru.
The absolutization of this power can give rise to the perverted logic that if a person of low spiritual status is murdered by one with gedatsu then the former person’s karma improves, making the murder a good deed.
It would not be surprising if a notion of this type was secretly taught in Aum.
There was some hassle at the time.
We were arguing over who had mentioned a release date first.
It was all a bit petty.
I’d pegged a release date, and then Let It Be was scheduled near it.
I saw it as victimization, but now I’m sure it wasn’t.
What the name really meant to me was a terror-stricken man calling into the void for help that will never come.
Now, I have to go back to work on my State of the Union speech.
And I worked on it until pretty late last night.
But I want to say one thing to the American people.
I want you to listen to me.
I’m going to say this again.
I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.
I never told anybody to lie, not a single time; never.
These allegations are false.
And I need to go back to work for the American people.
Thank you.
It is with great regret that I declare that the Universal and International Exhibition of 1967 has come to an official end.
Phil came in, he said, ‘How do you want it?’ I said, ‘You know, 1950 but now.’
And he said ‘Right,’ and ‘boom’ . He doesn’t fuss about with fuckin’ stereo or all the bullshit.
Does it sound all right?
If it sounds good to you as a layman or as a human, take it.
Don’t bother whether this is like that or the quality of this, just take it.
After having arranged this mouse trap contrivance, into each bottle was poured rain water, to the height of an inch and a half; and a leech placed in every bottle, which was to be its future residence; and when influenced by the electromagnetic state of the atmosphere a number of leeches ascended into the tubes; in doing which they dislodged the whalebone and caused the bell to ring.
From the amazingly beautiful opening of the game, through the long storyline for each character, to the wonderfully upbeat ending, this game is a marvel.
It surprises you at every step and keeps the tension up right until the end.
In his terms, he did not want to write about black love, black passion, black suffering, black joy; he wanted to write about love and passion and suffering and joy.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in most weeks the funniest and cleverest programme on TV, reached new heights with "Hush".
Second, W3C has also evolved.
In the early days, turning a Working Draft into a Recommendation was a simple month-long stint as Proposed Recommendation.
These days, you have to issue call for comments, answer all the comments, make sure there are two implementations, and so forth.
The formal process has become much longer and only specifications that have serious backers end up as Recommendations.

Ultimately that failure to feel as fresh as Super Mario 3D Land is going to define New Super Mario Bros. 2 for many people, but it hides deeper treasures for those willing to look past the familiarity.
Even if it doesn’t pay off in the end, Mario’s gold rush lends the level design a unified focus.
It allows Nintendo to experiment and develop tricks we haven’t seen before, tweaks that expand on the language of a 2D Mario game in worthwhile ways.

The audience was so enchanted with this performance, that a stranger who should have seen the manner in which they were affected, would have imagined they had all been distracted.
The theatre, at almost every pause, resounded with shouts and acclamations of ‘viva il caro Sassone!’ and other expressions of approbation too extravagant to be mentioned.
They were thunderstruck with the grandeur and sublimity of his stile: for never had they known till then all the powers of harmony and modulation so closely arrayed, and so sorcibly combined.
I couldn’t have felt prouder and I felt very emotional that the people of Manchester had come out in such numbers to pay their respects to me.

After an hour of ultra-modern music, strident, formless, passionate music that stirred the blood with clangor of brass, the shrieks of strings, the plaint of wood winds and disdained to woo the senses with flower-soft melodic phrase, the audience at the Metropolitan Opera House clamored for the composer and held its breath when she appeared.

I've said many a time that I think the Un-American Activities Committee in the House of Representatives was the most un-American thing in America!
In so splendid and fashionable an assembly of ladies (to the excellence of their taste we must impute it) there was no shadow of form or ceremony, scarce indeed any appearance of order or regularity, politeness or decency.
Many, who had forc’d their way into the house with an impetuosity but ill suited to their rank and sex, actually fainted through the excessive heat and closeness of it.
Several gentlemen were turned back, who had offered forty shillings for a seat in the gallery, after having despaired of getting any in the pit of boxes.
Can anyone even remember now what Nixon did that was so terrible?
He ended the war in Vietnam, brought home the POWs, ended the war in the Mideast, opened relations with China, started the first nuclear weapons reduction treaty, saved Eretz Israel's life, started the Environmental Protection Administration.
Does anyone remember what he did that was bad?
Oh, now I remember.
He lied.
He was a politician who lied.
How remarkable.
He lied to protect his subordinates who were covering up a ridiculous burglary that no one to this date has any clue about its purpose.
He lied so he could stay in office and keep his agenda of peace going.
That was his crime.
He was a peacemaker and he wanted to make a world where there was a generation of peace. And he succeeded.
That is his legacy.
He was a peacemaker.
He was a lying, conniving, covering up peacemaker.
He was not a lying, conniving drug addict like JFK, a lying, conniving war starter like LBJ, a lying, conniving seducer like Clinton—a lying, conniving peacemaker.
A boy.
I think we came together because we were both outsiders.
It was perfect.
But I think with that contentment also comes sadness.
There was something heavenly about that life – we’d go to work and he’d play his video games – but also it was maybe too regular.
At the time I was becoming disillusioned with being a singer and was very happy to settle with a boyfriend who I loved, but in the end we both lost sight of our dreams.
Maybe there's something not-so-special about domestic life.
I can tell you that Incat has hit a home run with this ship!
What an awesome piece of equipment.
We have had minimal problems during a higher than designed or intended operation tempo.
The vessel is near perfect for the intended U.S. Army mission, and in 18 plus years of driving and working about boats, I’ve never had so much fun.
We hit and sustained 48.7 knots running down the coast of Qatar, unbelievable.

One day in the interest of science my agent obtained permission to bring me to the students' dueling-place.
We crossed the river and drove up the bank a few hundred yards, then turned to the left, entered a narrow alley, followed it a hundred yards and arrived at a two-story public house; we were acquainted with its outside aspect, for it was visible from the hotel.
We went upstairs and passed into a large whitewashed apartment which was perhaps fifty feet long by thirty feet wide and twenty or twenty-five high.
It was a well-lighted place.
There was no carpet.
Across one end and down both sides of the room extended a row of tables, and at these tables some fifty or seventy-five students were sitting.
It’s a great day to be a particle physicist.
A lot of people have waited a long time for this moment, but their patience and dedication is starting to pay dividends.
A lot of people think there’s an intrinsic conflict between Christianity and evolution, but there isn’t.
Religion is about ethics and values, and science is about facts.
You need both of them, but they don’t interact very much.
I was engaged in a war.
I considered myself engaged in a war from Day One.
And my objective was to force the federal government – the Kennedy administration at that time – into a position where they would have to use the United States military force to enforce my rights as a citizen.
But the code was his.
The proof of this is that he messed the design up.
MINIX is a nice, modular microkernel system Linus rewrote the whole thing as a big monolithic kernel, complete with inline assembly code :-(.
The first version of Linux was like a time machine.
It went back to a system worse than what he already had on his desk.
Of course, he was just a kid and didn’t know better (although if he had paid better attention in class he should have), but producing a system that was fundamentally different from the base he started with seems pretty good proof that it was a redesign.
I don’t think he could have copied UNIX because he didn’t have access to the UNIX source code, except maybe John Lions’ book, which is about an earlier version of UNIX that does not resemble Linux so much.
It is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economic use of fuel is equivalent to a diminished consumption.
The very contrary is the truth.
Here, then, seems to be a path leading towards an explanation of the law of gravitation, which, if it can be shown to be in other respects consistent with facts, may turn out to be a royal road into the very arcana of science.
He thinks he is a girl and he spits eggs from his mouth.

"... when I described how they flew, I said that they flew like they take a saucer and throw it across the water.

In this section I will present an in-principle mathematical argument for why natural causes are incapable of generating complex specified information.
Traditionally, a paraffin test has been used in gunshot residue analysis (GSR).
To remove residues from the hand, casting with paraffin has been suggested.
This test lacks specificity, however, and at the Interpol meeting in 1968 it was officially stated that it no longer should be used.
The most successful technique to date for the analysis of GSR analysis is without doubt the Scanning Electron Microscope with an Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analyzer (SEM-EDX).
Paraffin test was for the above reasons not used by the Finnish Team.
Test samples for SEM-EDX were taken and they proved to be negative.
It clearly is a galvanising event, and the President really felt that we could then move forward, make clear that the US was going to be a part of an implementing force.

It is not the bad qualities, but the good qualities of these alien races that make them so dangerous to us.
It is their inexhaustible energy, their power of applying themselves to new tasks, their endurance and low standard of living that make them such competitors.

He may have had his fill of Dark Age blood-and-thunder melodrama.
Berenice and Arminio had been a come-down after the glories of the Ariosto operas, and though Giustino promised a new approach he had not yet found the lighter tone of Serse and Imeneo.
Strohm suggests that the libretto of Faramondo may have been chosen by Heidegger, and that Handel set it unwillingly.
However that may be, it is a very uneven opera, with half a dozen peaks where some facet set Handel’s genius alight, chiefly in Act II, but a good deal of routine matter.
Kelly contributes I Believe I Can Fly, whose go-for-it lyrics and florid orchestration seem to have been written with a future Disney musical in mind.
The right to the capital consists in the power to alienate the thing and the liberty to consume, waste or destroy the whole or part of it ... The latter liberty need not be regarded as unrestricted; but a general provision requiring things to be conserved in the public interest, so far as not consumed by use in the ordinary way, would perhaps be inconsistent with the liberal idea of ownership.
Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government.
And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell.
Welcome to the greatest show.
Greatest show on earth.
You’ve never seen before.
Also known as The Twelve-Year Project; Richard Linklater and I have made a short film every year for the last 11 years, one more to go, that follows the development of a young boy from age 6 to 18.
I play the father, and it's Tolstoy-esque in scope.
I thought the Before series was the most unique thing I would ever be a part of, but Rick has engaged me in something even more strange.
Doing a scene with a young boy at the age of 7 when he talks about why do raccoons die, and at the age of 12 when he talks about video games, and 17 when he asks me about girls, and have it be the same actor—to watch his voice and body morph—it's a little bit like timelapse photography of a human being. ... Next year, he will graduate high school and we will finish the film.
It will probably come out in two years.
We were just so happy he wanted to honor our work and our production.
Two female producers/writers, and for him as a rapper to take our song—that's not a combination you see a lot.
For him to be so open-minded about it, we just couldn't be any more grateful and thankful.
I was sorely afflicted with tunnel vision — a jejune and immature outlook — seeing only what I wanted to see because I thought the Klan could provide an outlet for my talents and ambitions.
Bodhi features the beautiful and lightweight Enlightenment window manager, and it’s especially notable for its excellent customizability.
Frankly, my witnesses are prostitutes, madams, heels, pimps and ex-convicts.
I wish to call to your attention that these are the only witnesses we could possibly have brought here.
We can’t get Bishops to testify in a case involving prostitution.
And this combination was not run under the arch lights of Madison Square Garden.
We have to use the testimony of bad men to convict other bad men.
Once at the absolute center of the American rock ’n’ roll scene, the Beach Boys found themselves woefully out of step with the mood and rhythm of the nation’s popular culture.
And perhaps it was inevitable.
In a year rent by public assassination, a bloody an controversial war, bitter protest on college campuses, and a racial divide that seemed only to grow more jagged as time went on, it’s impossible to imagine how a group of sweet-faced boyish utopian could capture anyone’s imagination.

Overall there was no increase in the actual number of rapes committed in West Germany during the years when pornography was legalized and became widely available.
I don’t believe in playing down to children, either in life or in motion pictures.
I didn’t treat my own youngsters like fragile flowers, and I think no parent should.
Children are people, and they should have to reach to learn about things, to understand things, just as adults have to reach if they want to grow in mental stature.
Life is composed of lights and shadows, and we would be untruthful, insincere, and saccharine if we tried to pretend there were no shadows.
Most things are good, and they are the strongest things; but there are evil things too, and you are not doing a child a favor by trying to shield him from reality.
The important thing is to teach a child that good can always triumph over evil, and that is what our pictures attempt to do.
EC aerosol can contain some of the toxicants present in tobacco smoke, but at levels which are much lower.
Long-term health effects of EC use are unknown but compared with cigarettes, EC are likely to be much less, if at all, harmful to users or bystanders.

Professor Michael E. Fisher has been an extraordinarily productive scientist, and one still at the height of his powers and creativity.
Fisher's major contributions have been in equilibrium statistical mechanics, and have spanned the full range of that subject.
He was mainly responsible for bringing together, and teaching a common language to chemists and physicists working on diverse problems of phase transitions.
For the first time in the history of the world, a young girl climbed into a tree one day a Princess and after having what she described as her most thrilling experience she climbed down from the tree next day a Queen — God bless her.
When Llywelyn died in 1240 his principatus of Wales rested on shaky foundations.
Although he had dominated Wales, exacted unprecedented submissions and raised the status of the prince of Gwynedd to new heights, his three major ambitions – a permanent hegemony, its recognition by the king, and its inheritance in its entirety by his heir – remained unfulfilled.
His supremacy, like that of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, had been merely personal in nature, and there was no institutional framework to maintain it either during his lifetime or after his death.
I thought, I’m not going to make one of them you know sort of clattery records like everybody else seems to be doing this period.
I’m going to make a record like something like I did twenty years ago.
Just like a rock ’n’ roll band making a record.
We had real saxes and real guitars, real pianos, real drums, real people playing real songs.
Eddie’s gimmicks – which include singing through the electric sax and playing his reed trumpet – overwhelm the musical content here, and the thin production makes the keyboards and rhythm sections sound even weedier than they were.

It would be neither fitting nor efficacious for this Government to undertake to draw up unilaterally a program designed to place Europe on its feet economically.
This is the business of the Europeans.
The initiative, I think, must come from Europe.
The role of this country should consist of friendly aid in the drafting of a European program and of later support of such a program so far as it may be practical for us to do so.
The program should be a joint one, agreed to by a number, if not all European nations.
I'm doing 2D.

It gets a little preachy at times, making it hard for everyone to enjoy, and repetitive or over-the-top with its mockery of American culture, but I thought it was hilarious.
It's not as good as World&apos;s Greatest Dad, but it's definitely amusing.
It is very likely that average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were higher than for any other 50-year period in the last 500 years. It is also likely that this 50-year period was the warmest Northern Hemisphere period in the last 1.3 kyr, and that this warmth was more widespread than during any other 50-year period in the last 1.3 kyr."
The feeling of a guy in the First World War who's just about to run out the trenches… and he knows his life is going to be gone in ten minutes and he thinks of that fucker back in Westminster who put him in that position.

I wanted to write a song, the type of song that I would buy if I were to buy a rock song… That is how I approached it and I wanted the kids to really enjoy it—the school kids as well as the college kids.

They extend for some 16,000 kilometres in all, in a mosaic of more than 500 interconnected settlement boundaries.
They cover 6,500 square kilometres and were all dug by the Edo people.
In all, they are four times longer than the Great Wall of China, and consumed a hundred times more material than the Great Pyramid of Cheops.
They took an estimated 150 million hours of digging to construct, and are perhaps the largest single archaeological phenomenon on the planet.

If Mr. Thurston ever wants a testimonial for his Billiards Hall, he can have on from me.
The moment I entered the place I felt I was about to enjoy myself.
It is small, snug, companionable.
Four or five rows of plush chairs look down on the great table, above which is a noble shaded light, the shade itself being russet-colored.
Autumn to the cloth’s bright Spring.
Most of the chairs were filled with comfortable men, smoking pipes.
I noticed a couple of women among the spectators, but they looked entirely out of place, just as they would have done among the fat leather chairs of a West End club.
I had just time to settle down in my seat, fill and light a pipe myself, before the match began …
Last week died, at Godalmin, in Surry, Mary Tofts, formerly noted for an imposition of breeding rabbits.

No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.
Joe, you ain't no Pauli. (Paul Castellano)
It's the first time that our whole lives aren't hanging on the success of a record.
And everyone has slightly better shoes.
When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to abolish the Negro race, proper methods should be used.
Among these are guns, bows and arrows, sling shots and knives.
We hold these truths to be self-evident that all whites are created equal with certain rights; among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of dead niggers.
Previous classifications of the American Gesneriaceae were long outdated.
It is likely that the 16 countries bordering on the Mediterranean, with such a range of different races, climates, and products, can enjoy as much unhealthy food as the rest of the world, and the myth of an universal, simple, beneficial diet is a salutary ideal rather than a reality.
If it's really true that the museum at Liberty University has dinosaur fossils which are labeled as being 3,000 years old, then that is an educational disgrace.
It is debauching the whole idea of a university, and I would strongly encourage any members of Liberty University who may be here, to leave and go to a proper university.
Recorded in concert with Reed's crack road band at the peak of their form, Rock 'n' Roll Animal offered a set of his most anthemic songs (most dating from his days with the Velvet Underground) in arrangements that presented his lean, effective melodies and street-level lyrics in their most user-friendly form (or at least as user friendly as an album with a song called "Heroin" can get).
Embedded in the game is a classic immigrant story.
Mario and Luigi are Italians in a strange land, blue-collar workers who travel back and forth between an above-ground mainstream and various undergrounds, moving through worlds (or class strata?) accumulating stuff, strength, and respect, all in a quest to get to a big house where they'll liberate a beautiful woman — the final stage of the class-passing dream.
Along the way, they hustle and fight and scrape to collect artificial performance enhancers (mushrooms, fire flowers) and currency (all of which can extend their lifelines), banging their heads against rocks to get ahead.
They quickly learn the only thing more important than timing is artful cheating: With the prevalence of warp zones, shortcutting the system is part of the superstructure.
As the landscape becomes more treacherous and competition more fierce, they find that they can no longer survive without the "boost" of mushrooms and invincibility stars.
In the final stages, they race against the clock in abject desperation, roided-out addicts making stupid, careless mistakes in their frenzy to ascend just one more level.
Maybe they find and save the princess in the end, but at what cost?
It could be a lost Godfather sequel. It could be Scarface.
This song ain’t black or white and as far as I know don’t infringe on anyone’s copyright…
I went to the top of the hill & had a lay on the grass & it put me in mind of old times at Home sitting on the hillside looking down at the sea.
I said that if you go on with this - they were discussing bombing Biba the legendary department store in Kensington - I'm going to call the police in, because I really don't believe in this.
Stands in the dole queue, face like a statue / Laugh like a maniac, walk like a king, too / Spiked hair, don’t care.
Oxfam outlaw / Rap band rips it out, you’re buzzing like a chainsaw
Only few cloud dedicated research projects in the widest sense have been initiated – most prominent amongst them probably OpenNebula.
I do not believe there is a Silurian bed among them, and I am more than disposed to think that the whole is Devonian, except, perhaps, the westward flanks.
The limestones are undistinguishable from those of Plymouth and North Devon, and the organic remains are all of the same classes which occur in those rocks – Goniatites, large Spirifers, etc.
The whole point is that the album doesn’t have a title.
We decided quite a while ago, that we didn’t want to give any of the albums titles, they were just going to be called 'Franz Ferdinand'.
The albums are going to be identified by their colour schemes rather than a title.
The contrast of different colours creates a different mood.
We experimented with different combinations of colours and this one stuck.
I particularly felt strongly that since we had several heterosexual marriages available in Hommlet, we should include at least one homosexual encounter in the game (although there were actually two, one was in the brothel that was removed) and not to make it a stereotyped, over the top situation, but on par with the other relationships available in the game.
I felt strongly about keeping the character of Bertram in the game, and I am glad we were allowed to keep him, despite any controversy it might cause.
It's been entertaining reading the boards about Bertram and reactions to him.
White Lies may not be a perfect album, but it's certainly a promising step forward for a real talent.
Power pop is what we play — what the Small Faces used to play, and the kind of pop the Beach Boys played in the days of ‘Fun, Fun, Fun’ which I preferred.
and the jig was always a favourite as long as movements in that measure were in fashion.
Handel himself seems to have been not insensible to its merit, for I heard him play it by memory as a lesson at Mrs. Cibber’s, with wonderful neatness and spirit near twenty years after it was composed.
As a homosexual, you are not even a human being . You have fallen from dignitiy.
One can easily imagine a Disney World ride based on the film, with tourists climbing into an egg-shaped craft for a wild ride down a long and dark fallopian tube through a giant vaginal opening.
Maybe there could be a catchy theme song, along the lines of “It’s a Small World,” to add music to the menstruation – giving the vagina a voice, if you will?
Kotex could sponsor the ride and sell feminine products at the concession stands.
It could make millions!
Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously by any means whatsoever wound or cause any grievous bodily harm to any person to do some grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist or prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any person, shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable to be kept in penal servitude for life.
I was never at his Waldorf apartment.
And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.
But a new era dawned on cancer research when Johannes Fibiger of Copenhagen presented his brilliant experiments on the production of gastric cancer in rats.
Then, for the first time could it be said that cancer had been produced experimentally beyond all doubt, and exploration into the etiology of cancer became practical problems.
From the first moments when Dexter Gordon sails into the opening song full of brightness and confidence, it is obvious that Go! is going to be one of those albums where everything just seems to come together magically... Gordon had many high points in his five decade-long career, but this is certainly the peak of it all.
… is a world not of angels, but of angles where men speak if moral principles but act on power principles.
I AM favoured w th y rs of y e 15 th instant, & shall Endeav r to observe punctually w t you write about.
I find y t Senesino or Carestini are dersired at 1200 G s each, if they are to be had; Im’e sure that Carestini is Engaged at Milan, & has been so, for many Months past: and I hear y t Senesino, is Engaged for y e ensuing Carnival at Rome.
If Senesino is at liberty (& will accept y e offer) then the affair is adjusted if Sig ra Barbara Pisani accepts the offer I made her, which I really believe she will.
If we can neither get Senesino, nor Carestini, then M r Handel desires to have a man (Soprano) & a woman contrealt, & y t The price (for both) must not exceed one Thousand or Eleven hundred Guineas, & that the persons must sett out for London y e latter end of Aug t or beginning of Septemb r , and y t no Engagem t must be Made w th one with t a certainty of getting the other.
Several of the persons recomended to M r Handel (whose names he repeats in y e letters I received from him this Morning) are I think exceedingly indifferent, & Im’e persuaded wou’d never doe in England: & I think shou’d never be pitch’d on, till nobody else can be had.
I have heard a Lad here, of a bt 19 years old, w th a very good soprano voice (& of whom there are vast hopes) who Im’e persuaded, would do very well in London, and much better than any of those mentioned in M r Handel’s letter who are not already engaged in case you cannot get Senesino.
Having not time to answer Mr. Handel’s Letter, this day, I hope you will be so good as to let him know y t I shall Endeav r to serve him to the utmost of my power, & y t I shall do nothing but w t shall be concerted by you.
The 3DS has a couple of great games from Nintendo.
The problem is that they’re remakes of N64 titles.
Gamers were glad to experience classics , but no one buys a new system to play games over a decade old.
That all changes with the excellent Super Mario 3D Land, an all-new adventure in the Mushroom Kingdom
If my name wasn’t James Marcello, I wouldn’t be standing in front of you.
That’s all I have to say.
On board ship, he was one of the authors of the ‘constitution’, inscribed on a toilet roll, for self-government of the internees.
Kept under appalling conditions and surviving a torpedo attack, they reached Australia after fifty-seven days, there to be placed in an internment camp .
I pledge allegiance to the flag of Michigan, and to the state for which it stands, two beautiful peninsulas united by a bridge of steel, where equal opportunity and justice to all is our ideal.
On Saturday evening, he and I were at home, for he lived with me; he said he had frightened two ladies and a gentleman who were coming along the terrace in a carriage, for that the man said, he dared to say there goes the ghost; that he said he was no more a ghost than he was, and asked him, using a bad word, did he want a punch of the head; I begged of him to change his dress; Thomas, says I, as there is a piece of work about the ghost, and your cloaths look white, pray do put on your great coat, that you may not run any danger.
Gamers who were fans of the Wing Commander series on the PC may be disappointed that Colony Wars tends to feel more like an arcade game than an epic, engaging adventure.
Once in the cockpit, you are taken through the dynamic visual world of your own interactive sci-fi movie: a long film, with a heavy dose of special effects and action, but one that is definitely short of being a classic.
Cantatas of considerable length, accompanied by a numerous band are usually performed in Italy on great occasions of festivity: as the reconciliation of princes after long disunion, or the arrival of great personages in the capital of a state.
But these differ essentially from what is usually meant by a cantata or monologue for a single voice, consisting of short recitatives, and two or three airs at most; as they are occasional poems in which several singers are employed; but though in dialogue, they are performed, like oratorios, without change of scene, or action.
A very interesting CD of material from Sonny Rollins… These are among Rollins's most avant-garde improvisations for he seems inspired by trumpeter Don Cherry's presence (although Cherry clearly could not keep up with the great tenor)
Radical Women is dedicated to exposing, resisting, and eliminating the inequities of women’s existence.
To accomplish this task of insuring survival for an entire sex, we must simultaneously address ourselves to the social and material source of sexism: the capitalist form of production and distribution of products, characterized by intrinsic class, race, sex, and caste oppression.
When we work for the revolutionary transformation of capitalism into a socialist society, we work for a world in which all people may enjoy the right of full humanity and freedom from poverty, war, racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and repression.
The United States will meet its commitment under Article VI of the NPT to pursue nuclear disarmament and will make demonstrable progress over the next five to ten years.
We will work to reduce the role and numbers of U.S. nuclear weapons while enhancing security for ourselves, and our allies and partners.
We want to setup a system whereby people who just want to make a film about anything don't have to go on their knees in somebody's office (probably yours).
was made up of little pieces I developed when I was with the Yardbirds, as were other numbers such as “Dazed And Confused”.
It was played live in the studio with cues and nods.
A Scholar of M r Gates, Beard, (who left the Chappell last Easter) shines in the Opera of Covent Garden & M r Hendell is so full of his Praises that he says he will surprise the Town with his performances before the Winter is over.
The concept of Floer homology is one of the most striking developments in differential geometry over the past 20 years. The ideas have led to great advances in the areas of low-dimensional topology and symplectic geometry and are intimately related to developments in Quantum Field Theory the full richness of Floer’s theory is only beginning to be explored.
Japan, under the necessity of her self-preservation and self-defense, has reached a position to declare war on the United States of America, United Kingdom and the Netherlands.
The Supreme Commander of the Combined Fleet will start the war with an attack on the enemy fleet in the Hawaii Islands area and destroy it with the 1st Air Fleet.
The way he snatched the ball out of the air was amazing, and his diving was quite spectacular....Certainly, if the talent he showed on Saturday is maintained, Trautmann will be the talk of the league for long.
So, you'll find that the more reasonable ones of the Khmer Rouge will have to play some part in the future government, but only a minority part.
I share your utter horror that these terrible things went on in Kampuchea.
to get back to the haircut.
I should know!
We saw a guy in Hamburg, whose hair we liked.
John and I were hitchhiking to Paris.
We asked him to cut our hair like he did his.
He was living in Paris.
He was sort of an artsy guy, a photographer friend of everyone. His name was Jürgen
»But there are no such things as water-babies.« How do you know that?
Have you been there to see?
And if you had been there to see, and had seen none, that would not prove that there were none.
I’m now a legend.
I’m also the greatest athlete to live.
Jenna Fischer shines in this manipulative dramedy set in ennui-ridden suburbia.
Take it all in all–the depth of the snowfall, the tremendous wind, the amount of damage done and the total unpreparedness of the people–I think it is safe to say that the present storm is the worst experienced in Cleveland during the whole forty-three years the Weather Bureau has been established in the city.
The exhibition is a little history of someone very small who became someone very big.
Ultimately, we are all very small but Freddie was exceptional.
This country shall remain forever the home of the descendants of those people who came here in peace in order to establish in the South Seas an outpost of the British race.
I was so tired of the parts I had to play.
Why is it that the screen Chinese is always the villain?
And so crude a villain – murderous, treacherous, a snake in the grass.
We are not like that.
How could we be, with a civilization that is so many times older than the West?
Nixon is a guy who doesn't know how to talk, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, doesn't chase women, doesn't know how to play golf, doesn't know how to play tennis… he can't even fish.
I saw Frankie DeCicco laying on the ground beside the car.
With the fire, it could blow up again.
I tried to pull him away.
I grabbed a leg, but he ain't coming with it. The leg is off.
One of his arms is off.
I got my hand under him and my hand went right through his body to his stomach. There's no ass.
His ass, his balls, everything, is blown completely off. I was wearing a white shirt.
I looked at my shirt, amazed.
There wasn't a drop of blood on it.
The force of the blast, the concussion, blew most of the fluids out of Frankie's body. He had no blood left in him, nothing, not an ounce.
A strangle tango in the dark, dark / Fuck like a dog, bite like a shark, shark / Austerity makes you want to ROckWrok, ROckWrok
I experienced this amazing game just as the Playstation was about to be released, and in that respect it serves as a fitting swansong to the 16-bit era in my eyes.
The music is some of the best you are likely to hear ANYWHERE, let along on the SNES.
Use no big stuff if the sub surfaces – chase the crew overboard with 50 calibre fire.
Well, Adam, it’s my guess that the old-fashioned political campaign in a few years will be as extinct as the dodo.
It’ll be all TV and radio, it’ll all be streamlined and nice and easy.
Oh mind you, I use the TV and the radio sometimes, but I also get out into the wards.
I speak in arenas, armories, street corners—anywhere I can gather a crowd.
I even kiss babies.
But that’s the way I’ve always done it, and I must say it’s usually paid off.
But there’s no use kidding myself about it.
It’s on its way out, just as I am.
Yes, yes, this is my last campaign, Adam, the last hurrah.
No physical hypothesis founded on any indisputable fact has yet explained the origin of the primordial protoplasm, and, above all, of its marvellous properties, which render evolution possible—in heredity and in adaptability, for these properties are the cause and not the effect of evolution.
For the cause of this cause we have sought in vain among the physical forces which surround us, until we are at last compelled to rest upon an independent volition, a far-seeing intelligent design.
Mr Manning’s treatment has been intended to send a signal to people of conscience in the US government who might seek to bring wrongdoing to light.
This strategy has spectacularly backfired, as recent months have proven. Instead, the Obama administration is demonstrating that there is no place in its system for people of conscience and principle.
Sosarme does more honour to Handel as an musician than as a dramatist The characters sing exquisite music The variety of resource in rhythm, melody, harmony and design is as striking as in any of the operas; all three duets and the final coro are of exceptional merit.
Yet Sosarme remains too close to the received idea of opera seria as a string of unmatched pearls.
In Feb ry Sosarmes – a New Opera – by Hendell – took much & was for many Nights much crowded to some peoples admiration.
If one day, the Islamic world is also equipped with weapons like those that Israel possesses now, then the imperialists' strategy will reach a standstill because the use of even one nuclear bomb inside Israel will destroy everything.
However, it will only harm the Islamic world.
It is not irrational to contemplate such an eventuality.
when the 600th Anniversary of the Kosovo Battle with the Turks was held at Gazimestan in 1989, Slobodan Milosevic stated that he will »unite all Serbs into one state, either with institutional or non-institutional measures, even with weapons if necessary«, what was done in 1991.

And whatever story the sales figures tell, Leaders Of The Free World is an ambitious and beautiful album that confirms Elbow as one of the bands of our generation.
In the circle in which I travel, a dumb man is more dangerous than a hundred rats.
My word Opheliac, is derived from Shakespeare’s character, so the closeness in every aspect of the album is clear enough, but Opheliac is more of a rant against one’s self – in that particular song, I was not writing to get away from anybody’s grasp but my own.
I think that the LMP1s are the best cars after the F1 single-seaters and that's another reason why I chose endurance.
All the young drivers dream of Formula 1, but the budget necessary is too high for someone from a small country like the Czech Republic.
Everyone talks about Kurt's love affair with… the whole punk scene, but he was also a huge Beatles fan, and the more time we spent together the more obvious their influence on his songwriting became.
It’s about my daughter, Teddy.
Go Gentle is a promise of protection.
It’s a song that I want to live up to, because it’s actually the most important thing I will do on the planet while I’m here - either be a good or a bad dad.
Way more important than four nights at Wembley, three nights at Knebworth.
Mr. Handel, who has been some time indisposed with the rheumatism, is in so fair a way of recovery, that it is hoped he will be able to accompany the opera of Justin on Wednesday next, the 4th of May; at which time we hear their Majesties will honour that opera with their presence.
For people with acute ISSHL, the application of HBOT significantly improved hearing, but the clinical significance remains unclear...
There is no evidence of a beneficial effect of HBOT on chronic ISSHL or tinnitus and we do not recommend the use of HBOT for this purpose.
Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a "hobby" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas.
My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands.
I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix-/C-Hackers.
I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).
Their Majesties intend being at the Opera in Covent-Garden To-night; and we hear the new Opera will exceed any Composition of Mr. Handel's hitherto performed.
I now have a 7-year-old boy and a 9-year-old boy, so all I can say is, I apologize.
Now I know what you guys were talking about.
My standard comment is, If you don't want your kids to be like Bart Simpson, don't act like Homer Simpson.
It represents a record company with absolutely no idea what the fuck they were going to do.
If we would have had more time it could have been better.
It looks like some seventh-grader defaced a Bible.
Y r Lord p’s information concerning M r Handel’s Disorder was y e first I received – I can assure Y r Lord p it gave me no Small Concern – when y e Fate of Harmony depends upon a Single Life, the Lovers of Harmony may be well allowed to be Sollicitous.

On more than one occasion, I entered the precincts of some great Shintô centre, particularly Ise, with groups of foreigners who knew absolutely nothing about it and were not particularly interested, and yet were so deeply struck with the atmosphere they found there that some of them actually shed tears.
A Big Ball of Mud is a haphazardly structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape-and-baling-wire, spaghetti-code jungle.
These systems show unmistakable signs of unregulated growth, and repeated, expedient repair.
Information is shared promiscuously among distant elements of the system, often to the point where nearly all the important information becomes global or duplicated.
The overall structure of the system may never have been well defined. If it was, it may have eroded beyond recognition.
Programmers with a shred of architectural sensibility shun these quagmires.
Only those who are unconcerned about architecture, and, perhaps, are comfortable with the inertia of the day-to-day chore of patching the holes in these failing dikes, are content to work on such systems.
We are informed from very good Authority; that there is now near finished a Statue of the justly celebrated Mr. Handel, exquisitely done by the ingenious Mr. Raubillac, of St. Martin’s-Lane, Statuary, out of one entire Block of white Marble, which is to be placed in a grand Nich, erected on Purpose in the great Grove at Vaux-hall-Gardens, at the sole Expence of Mr. Tyers, Undertaker of the Entertainment there; who in Consideration of the real Merit of that inimitable Master, thought it proper, that his Effigies should preside there, where his Harmony has so often charm’d even the greatest Crouds into the profoundest Calm and most decent Behaviour; it is believed, that the Expence of the Statue and Nich cannot cost less than Three Hundred Pounds; the said Gentleman likewise very generously took at Mr. Handel’s Benefit Fifty of his Tickets.
We must be very careful when we speak of exercising "leadership" in Asia.
We are deceiving ourselves and others when we pretend to have answers to the problems, which agitate many of these Asiatic peoples.
Furthermore, we have about 50% of the world's wealth but only 6.3 of its population.
This disparity is particularly great as between ourselves and the peoples of Asia.
In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment.
Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships, which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity without positive detriment to our national security. To do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and daydreaming; and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives.
We need not deceive ourselves that we can afford today the luxury of altruism and world benefaction… In the face of this situation we would be better off to dispense now with a number of the concepts which have underlined our thinking with regard to the Far East.
We should dispense with the aspiration to 'be liked' or to be regarded as the repository of a high-minded international altruism. We should stop putting ourselves in the position of being our brothers' keeper and refrain from offering moral and ideological advice.
We should cease to talk about vague — and for the Far East — unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of the living standards, and democratization.
The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.
My life would have been a lot simpler had Nicholas von Hoffman not appeared in the paper.
I firmly believed that he belonged at the Post.
Bertrand Russell’s History of Western Philosophy is amusing, but suffers from defects ...
First, it deals largely with ancient philosophy, and is curt and selective in its treatment of the post-Cartesian tradition.
Secondly, it is dismissive towards all those philosophers with whom Russell felt no personal affinity.
Thirdly, it shows no understanding of Kant and post-Kantian idealism.
It is, for all that, a classic of wit, elegance and resolute idiosyncrasy.
To get rid of that dejection of mind, which his repeated disappointments had brought on him
Though there were many giants of old in physics and philosophy, yet I say with Didacus Stella, 'A dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant may see farther than a giant himself’; I may likely add, alter, and see farther than my predecessors .
I was a deck boy on the MV Laguna on a voyage from Liverpool to New York during September 1944.
It was a convoy seven days out of Liverpool when order was given to scatter and make for New York without escort.
This was due to the imminence of a hurricane in the path of the convoy.
We encountered the edge of the hurricane and soon afterwards steamed into fair weather and blue skies.
We were then 5 days or 1000 miles from New York when we ran through a massive swarm of monarch butterflies.
I remember standing on deck watching this mass of colourful creatures fluttering around the ship's rigging.
On arrival in New York I learned that the hurricane had turned westward, crossing Long Island, N.Y.
If I have not seen as far as others, it is because there were giants standing on my shoulders
All you need for a movie is a gun and a girl.
Robert's voice was extremely powerful and, as a result, would get on some of the other tracks.
But oddly, the leakage sounds intentional.
By God, I'll never forget the feeling of power – power about to be unleashed – that welled up in me as I viewed the long, endless columns of ships headed toward Normandy.

We hear, since Operas have been forbidden being performed at the Theatre in Covent Garden on the Wednesdays and Fridays in Lent, Mr. Handel is preparing Dryden’s Ode of Alexander’s Feast, the Oratorios of Esther and Deborah, with several new Concertos for the Organ and other Instruments; also an Entertainment of Musick, called II Trionfo del Tempo e della Verita, which Performances will be brought on the Stage and varied every Week.

Joe came up to Mike and me and asked us to take the whole idea of Minutes to Midnight and apply that to how the band has changed.
So, in a way, it's us saying goodbye to how we used to be...The lyrics in the first verse are 'In this farewell, there's no blood, there's no alibi,' and right away, you'll notice that the band sounds different: The drums are much more raw, the guitars are more raw and the vocals aren't tripled.
It's just us out there .... and that's how Rick Rubin wanted it.
Stopping any album in the middle of recording to go to a funeral can’t possibly be a good sign.
For the next three months I had to go back and mix it and listen to his riffs every day, and think about him every day.
It was pretty tough to do - a lot harder than I thought it was gonna be.
I thought I could put him out of my mind and just mix.
But of course, when something as awful as that happens, it gets to you.
I just had to power through it knowing I was doing Mikey proud and it was for the best.

Urban Bushmen not only provides an excellent summation of the Art Ensemble of Chicago's work since 1966, but also substantiates the group's reputation for putting on intense and inspired shows....This is one of the Art Ensemble's best recordings, but due to its intense breadth it might not be an ideal first purchase for newcomers.

Everytime I hear that song, it means something else to me.
It started out as a simple good-bye song… Probably just to a girl, but I see how it could be a goodbye to a kind of childhood.
I really don’t know.
I think it’s sufficiently complex and universal in its imagery that it could be almost anything you want it to be.
She sometimes seems like a woman encountered at a Greyhound station and inveigled before the camera – unready, ungiving, suspicious, yet definitely there; more than an actress.
I think Quicksort is the only really interesting algorithm that I’ve ever developed.

Then I found out the political climate in Germany is alot different then here in Australia.
If I had of known I think I would’ve been a lot more silent about these issues.
The bottom line is, D’666 are a metal band, not a political band.
I might sing about the spirit of things as I see them, but not political strategy or ideal. And we have never been racist.

The disappearing road line, old fence lines, stands of exotic trees, occasional brick chimneys, and this bridge serve as reminders of the ill fated settlement of the Mangapurua valley.
The ancient Poets animated all sensible objects with Gods or Geniuses, calling them by the names and adorning them with the properties of woods, rivers, mountains, lakes, cities, nations, and whatever their enlarged & numerous senses could perceive.
And particularly they studied the genius of each city & country, placing it under its mental deity; Till a system was formed, which some took advantage of & enslav'd the vulgar by attempting to realize or abstract the mental deities from their objects: thus began Priesthood; Choosing forms of worship from poetic tales.
And at length they pronounc'd that the Gods had order'd such things.
Thus men forgot that All deities reside in the human breast.
Drugs worked for me for years, and now they're turning against me — and now I'm walking through hell, and this sucks.
Apart from the ongoing server issues and memory usage, I've had a fantastic time playing Path of Exile this week.
I didn't really find the story behind the quests very appealing, but I don't think many people play action RPGs for the story.
The art style and randomised maps gave me some serious D2 nostalgia, and the permanent character customisation options and ladder plans are the biggest things missing from Diablo III.
In my opinion, Path of Exile is the sequel Diablo II deserved.
So I’m the last survivor and it’s so ironic, cause I was the oldest of the four of us.
Isn’t that silly?
Everyone by then could agree that Stalin was a very wicked man and a very evil one, but we still wanted to believe in Lenin; and Conquest said that Lenin was just as bad and that Stalin was simply carrying out Lenin's programme.
You are a victim of… of, let's see, we need a new word for it… How about: genopsycholinguisticide.
Sure, why not: „first there was the word… and the word was nigger,“ and you became–nigger.
And that, dear nigger, dear lost, blown-up bleeding, stumbling, raggedy nigger, that is genopsycholinguisticide.
Now get to that!
Nigger.
There goes a report of the Holland Women, that together with their Children, they are delivered of a Sooterkin, not unlike to a Rat …
But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people.
Try and leave this world a little better than you found it …
It may one day come to be recognised that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate.
What else is it that should trace the insuperable line?
Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse?
But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month old.
But suppose they were otherwise, what would it avail?
The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?
I have wrote a sort of Tragedy on the Story of Alceste, which will (without fail) be acted at Covent Garden next Season and appear with such magnificence of Scenery as was never exhibited in Britain before.

...Respecting the situation of Malta with the King of Naples, it is this – he is the legitimate Sovereign of the Island: therefore, I am of opinion his Flag should fly.
At the same time, a Neapolitan garrison would betray it to the first man who would bribe him.
I am sure the King would have no difficulty in giving his Sovereignty to England; and I have lately, with Sir William Hamilton, got a Note that Malta should never be given to any Power without the consent of England...
P.S. – In case of the Surrender of Malta, I beg you will not do anything which can hurt the feelings of their Majesties.
Unite their Flag with England’s, if it cannot, from the disposition of the Islanders, fly alone.
But let old Charmers yield to new, Happy Soil, adieu, adieu.
While manifesting a marked ability, especially in the painting of the rower in the foreground, the whole effect is scarely satisfactory. The light on the water, on the rower and on the trees lining the bank indicates that the sun is blazing fiercely, but on looking upward one perceives a curiously dull leaden sky.
Hitler didn’t snub me – it was Franklin D. Roosevelt who snubbed me.

I’ve said many a time that I think the Un-American Activities Committee in the House of Representatives was the most un-American thing in America!
I love dry, in-your-face aggressive rock, without tons of reverb So we recorded it: close miking of the drums, no echoing.
The idea was to kind of let you feel like you were in a boxing match and just kept getting punched in the face.

One day, when I was about 18, my picture appeared on a magazine cover and they misspelled my name as ‘Fann Wong’.
I was really upset and threw a tantrum and demanded that the magazine publish an apology in the next issue.“ She stormed home and threw the offending magazine on the table to show her mother.
Before she could lament, her mother, Wong Siew Toy, saw the name and said delightedly: „Woon Fong, it is so sweet of you to do this!
I am so happy you went to such lengths for me.
It was at a USENIX Windows NT conference and Microsoft was presenting their future directions for NT.
One of their speakers said that they would release a UNIX integration package for NT that would contain the Korn Shell.
I knew that Microsoft had licensed a number of tools from MKS so I came to the microphone to tell the speaker that this was not the "real" Korn Shell and that MKS was not even compatible with ksh88.
I had no intention of embarrassing him and thought that he would explain the compromises that Microsoft had to make in choosing MKS Korn Shell.
Instead, he insisted that I was wrong and that Microsoft had indeed chosen a "real" Korn Shell.
After a couple of exchanges, I shut up and let him dig himself in deeper.
Finally someone in the audience stood up and told him what almost everyone in the audience knew, that I had written the 'real' Korn Shell.
I think that this is symbolic about the way the company works.
I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.

'Dorm Daze' is pretty much the definition of harmless fun; it's not terribly funny, though it essentially remains entertaining throughout.

It's needless to say; if you're a fan of this style of music you'll be sure to find a worthy album in this release.
It's certainly had a great length of time glued to my CD player, something which is becoming more and more of a rarity these days for a debut release from a melodic black/death band.
While Switzer and writer Robert Inman manage to give the boy life, they are not so successful with Duke and Gilbert.
Duke’s all-knowing, idealistic, near-patronizing demeanor wears on viewers’ patience, and Gilbert, particularly before she begins to soften her edges, is a nervous, nagging presence.
I never in all my life heard a better piece of musick nor better perform’d – the famous Castrato, Senesino made the principal Actor the rest were all Italians who sung with very good grace and action, however, the Audience was very thin so that I believe they get not enough to pay the Instruments in the orchestra.
I was surprised to see the number of Instrumental Masters for there were 2 Harpsichords, 2 large basse violins each about 7 foot in length at least with strings proportionable that cou’d not be less than a ¼ of an inch diameter, 4 violoncellos, 4 bassoons, 2 Hautbois, 1 Theorbo lute & above 24 violins.
These made a terrible noise & often drown’d the voices.
One Signior Montagnania sung the bass with a voice like a Canon.
I never remember to have heard any thing like him. amongst the violins were 2 Brothers of the name Castrucci who play’d with great dexterity.
We’d previously done a „demo“ of Hiroshima mon Amour in a rocker type of arrangement but it presented an ideal opportunity to try out the drum machine, so it was rearranged for the TR-77.

It appears that more than a fourth part of the stock is held by foreigners, and the residue is held by a few hundred of our own citizens, chiefly of the richest class.
For their benefit does this act exclude the whole American people … It is but justice and good policy, as far as the nature of this case will admit, to confine our favors to our own fellow-citizens.
Let me say that of all the major politicians I've covered in presidential politics in the last two or three times around, he is the most likely to stick with an issue, even if the polls are bad, and to govern from the gut as you said.
I don't always agree with the decisions that he makes, but I think he is an honorable man, and when I've criticized him, I've tried to criticize him on the substance, and certainly not on his personality, because I really like the guy.
The descending riff is amazing: It's like a bow is being drawn back, and then it releases.
The rhythm of the vocals is almost like a rap.
It's insane — one of their most psychedelic songs.
And I am totally ready to adapt the story to whatever he is going through.
Lakewood exists because at a given time in a different economy it had seemed an efficient idea to provide population density for the mall and a labor pool for the Douglas plant When times were good and there was money to spread around, these were the towns that proved Marx wrong, that managed to increase the proletariat and simultaneously, by calling it middle class, to co-opt ist.
Such towns were organized around the sedative idealization of team sports, which were believed to develop „good citizens“, and therefore tended to the idealization of adolescent males.
During the good years the preferred resident was in fact an adolscent or post-adolscent male, ideally one already married and mortgaged, in harness to the plant, a good worker, a steady consument, a team player, someohne who played ball, a good citizen.
When towns like these came on hard times, it was the same adolescent males, only recently the community's most valued asset, who were most visibly left with nowhere to go.
...Ridgway overcame inadequacy.
Although he completed all the military education available, it was only after intense crucible of three combat operations that jhe eventually applied operational art successfully. Ridgway achieved tactical success but did not adequately apply operational art from HUSKY, NREPTUNE and MARKET.
Ridgeway learned from his failures and progressively improved his application of operational art during the BULGE and VARSITY. Not until his fifth experience, did he master operational art. ... the most important subcomponent of visualization depends on eleven elements of operational art.
These elements are the template this monograph uses
The Manhattan Transfer first came to the general public’s attention as a retro act, a nostalgic throwback in a era consumed with nostalgia As a result, this record seemed old when it came out, and it still sounds more than a little sappy, especially when one considers the astonishing growth of the Transfer since.
more solid, ingenious, and full of fire than any drama which Handel had yet produced in this country.
art of the whole philosophy of Activision was whether you're owned outright or not, if you're a studio you have control of your destiny, you could make decisions about who to hire, flexibility on what products to make, how to make them, schedules appropriate to make them, budgets.
The best summer songs remind you of your youth: what you did in your holidays, how it felt when you first kissed a boy, going away without your parents.
For me, our hit, Cruel Summer, played on the darker side: it looked at the oppressive heat, the misery of wanting to be with someone as the summer ticked by.
We've all been there!

that was titled "nashville" because that is the location that i am recording the solo album....in nashville, at ben folds' studio, with ben, who is producing the record and playing on it.
The Box in which their Royal Highnesses sat, was of white Satin, beautifully Ornamented with Festons of Flowers in their proper Colours, and in Front was a flaming Heart, between two Hymeneal Torches, whose different Flames terminated in one Point, and were surmounted with a Label, on which were wrote, in Letters of Gold, these Words, MUTUUS ARDOR.
Mr. Russell’s qualities as a writer and thinker ... are of a high order: deftness of wit, vigor of mind and suppleness of style.
Yet their presence ... do not save the book ... from being perhaps the worst that Mr. Russell has written....
As one would expect, the author is at his best when dealing with present day ideas, if for no other reason than his large share in their inception....
By contrast, his treatment of ancient and medieval doctrines is nearly worthless.
I thought that ‘lie la lie’ was a failure of songwriting.
I didn’t have any words!
Then people said it was ‘lie’ but I didn’t really mean that.
That it was a lie.
But, it’s not a failure of songwriting, because people like that and they put enough meaning into it, and the rest of the song has enough power and emotion, I guess, to make it go, so it’s all right.
But for me, every time I sing that part, I’m a little embarrassed.
There was something else I was saying that was more important than whether Tony Soprano lived or died.
About the fragility of all of it.
The whole show had been about time in a way, and the time allotted on this Earth.
Tony was dealing in mortality every day.
He was dishing out life and death.
And he was not happy.
He was getting everything he wanted, that guy, but he wasn’t happy.
All I wanted to do was present the idea of how short life is and how precious it is.
Am I supposed to do a scene and ending where it shows that crime doesn’t pay?
Well, we saw that crime pays.
We've been seeing that for how many years?
Now, in another sense, we saw that crime didn’t pay because it wasn't making him happy.
He was an extremely isolated, unhappy man.
And then finally, once in a while he would make a connection with his family and be happy there.
But in this case, whatever happened, we never got to see the result of that.
It was torn away from him and from us.
EIA is a highly-respected, hard-hitting, dirt-digging organisation.
If Chief Justice Warren and his associates had known God's word and had desired to do the Lord's will, I am quite confident that the 1954 decision would never had been made.
The facilities should be separate.
When God has drawn a line of distinction, we should not attempt to cross that line.
Just as an Individual is not bound to agree to being killed, neither a state is obliged to consent to being annihilated and erased from the map … The German Constitutional Court … spoke of a “fighting democracy”, which does not open its doors to acts of sabotage in the guise of legitimate parliamentary activity.
For myself, as far as Israel is concerned, I am prepared to confine myself to “self-defending democracy”, and tools for defending the existence of the state are at hand, even if we have not found them set forth in detail in the Elections Law.
Various aspects of Devoto's personality and legacy, truly brought forth throughout this album, have been transferred and blown up throughout the careers of Momus (the restless, unapologetic intellectual), Thom Yorke (the pensive outsider), and maybe even Luke Haines (the nonchalantly acidic crank).
Illmatic is the best hip-hop record ever made.
Not because it has ten great tracks with perfect beats and flawless rhymes, but because it encompasses everything great about hip-hop that makes the genre worthy of its place in music history.
Stylistically, if every other hip-hop record were destroyed, the entire genre could be reconstructed from this one album.
But in spirit, Illmatic can just as easily be compared to Ready to Die, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, and Enter the Wu-Tang as it can to Rites of Spring, A Hard Day’s Night, Innervisions, and Never Mind the Bollocks.
In Illmatic, you find the meaning not just of hip-hop, but of music itself: the struggle of youth to retain its freedom, which is ultimately the struggle of man to retain his own essence.
Our operas have given much cause of dissension; men and women have been deeply engaged; and no debate in the House of Commons has been urged with more warmth: the dispute of the merits of the composers and singers is carried to so great a height, that it is much feared, by all true lovers of music, that operas will be quite overturned.
I own I think we make a very silly figure about it.
What distinguishes science from all other human endeavours is that the accounts of the world that our best, mature sciences deliver are strongly supported by evidence and this evidence gives us the strongest reason to believe them.’ That anyway is what is said at the beginning of the advertisement for a recent conference on induction at a celebrated seat of learning in the UK.
It shows how much critical rationalists still have to do to make known the message of Logik der Forschung concerning what empirical evidence is able to do and what it does are rightly proud of having the only house in the neighbourhood that is logically watertight we must inevitably be aware that not everything inside is in impeccable order.
Listen to the yell of Leopold’s ghostBurning in Hell for his hand-maimed hostHear how the demons chuckle and yellCutting his hands off, down in Hell.
Honestly how interesting is it to hear about how the lyrics and riffs came about for the 12th Cannibal Corpse album that is exactly like the 11 before it?
No offense meant to CC, I like them and what they do serves an important purpose, but what I’m getting at is that music and art that pushes boundaries and progresses is often times more interesting to read/learn about then how many ways you can talk about disemboweling and then eating a corpse while riffing alternate versions of Angel of Death.
Mr King warned me against dabbling with the devil that is the major label, (he even threatened to break someone’s legs on my behalf), but I carried on regardless and made a record with a very ridiculous title and some even more questionable photographic evidence.
reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.
Signiora Faustina, a famous Italian Lady, is coming over this Winter to rival Signiora Cuzzoni.
So, at sixteen years and nine months, but looking four or five years older, and adorned with real whiskers which the scandalised Mother abolished within one hour of beholding, I found myself at Bombay where I was born, moving among sights and smells that made me deliver in the vernacular sentences whose meaning I knew not.
I have often heard it very publickly whisper’d, that some great People intended to have a larger Opera-House built; but what obstructed so noble and laudable a Design, I could never learn.
Had it been carried on, and executed, according to the Plans of some THEATRES in Italy, which are capale of containing an Audience of several Thousands, the Advantages resulting from so great an Undertaking would prove infinite.
An Opera-House so contriv’d as to allow a Number of Spectators, would admit of several Degrees of Seats, suited in their Prices to all Ranks of People, from the highest to the lowest Station of Life: And from an Audience so numerous, might be rais’d all Sums necessary to defray the greatest Expences; as the heaviest Taxes are made easy, by being made general.
But it is primitive nationalism, egged on by the self-deluding myth of Serbs as perennial victims, that has become both Mr Milosevic's rescuer (when communism collapsed with the Soviet Union) and his nemesis.
It was a stirringly virulent nationalist speech he made in Kosovo, in 1989, harking back to the Serb Prince Lazar's suicidally brave battle against the Turks a mere six centuries ago, that saved his leadership when the Serbian old guard looked in danger of ejection.
Now he may have become a victim of his own propaganda.
If the federal government is truly serious about doing something with the AIDS virus, we need to take steps that would isolate the carriers of this plague.
It is difficult to understand the public policy towards AIDS.
It is the first time in the history of civilization in which the carriers of a genuine plague have not been isolated from the general population, and in which this deadly disease for which there is no cure is being treated as a civil rights issue instead of the true health crisis it represents.

We are not enemies, but friends.

The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.
One day, Phil was playing the drums and I had the reverse talkback on because he was speaking, and then he started playing the drums.

It’s not exactly sci-fi noir, it’s more sci-fi gris.
Though it’s grey both in the sense of a sharp suit and also in the sense of just plain drab.
Frankly, my witnesses are prostitutes, madams, heels, pimps and ex-convicts… I wish to call to your attention that these are the only witnesses we could possibly have brought here.
We can’t get Bishops to testify in a case involving prostitution.
And this combination was not run under the arch lights of Madison Square Garden.
We have to use the testimony of bad men to convict other bad men.
It is not easy to sentence an old man, but you have to be sentenced for the things you have done and so that you will not be used as a role model for others
Trolling is a game about identity deception, albeit one that is played without the consent of most of the players.
Cross-Collateral is the album that shows how well this jazz band can rock and how well this rock band can play jazz.
Cross-Collateral was an international success and brought this band to greater prominence in the U.S.A., and it's easy to see why.
To put it simply, everything fits together perfectly.
Frenchy to Bluejay – I have a possible sound contact.
The hardest thing was listening to the children in school, reading postcards from German soldiers bragging.
And hearing them talk about the ‚low races‘.

In The Wire 175, we polled our writers to nominate records that should have ignited the world’s imagination – but somehow got forgotten along the way.

Evoland makes for a thoroughly enjoyable few hours, and I'd recommend it to any Zelda or Final Fantasy fan in a heartbeat.
While a few of the referential jokes cross over into cringe territory, most of them hit the mark, and there are a few little gags that really encourage a smirk, if not a real-life, out-loud chuckle.
It's incredibly difficult to fault what's on offer, but it's quite easy to lament what isn't there -- chiefly a lot more of what's on offer.

In the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.
The first is freedom of speech and expression – everywhere in the world.
The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way – everywhere in the world.
The third is freedom from want, which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants – everywhere in the world.
The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor – anywhere in the world.
In order to demonstrate to the enemy in Germany generally the overwhelming superiority of the Allied Air Forces in this theatre the intention is to apply within the shortest practical period the maximum effort of the Royal Air Force Bomber Command and the 8th United States Bomber Command against objectives in the densely populated Ruhr.

The European war was imperialistic, yet it led to the disappearance of three empires.
Have you in Japan ever thought that in your imperialistic aims you may end as a republic, and that is not at all what your rulers want?

Yes, in Xenoblade Chronicles, you play an orphaned young hero who, for reasons unexplained, is the only one capable of saving the world from a mysterious evil.
Yes, there is an ultimate weapon with untold power.
Yes, you wander a giant world in a party of three, following a story punctuated by enough cutscene to make the Godfather Trilogy look comparatively brisk.
But this is also one of the freshest and most innovative Japanese RPGs of the past decade. It feels more modern than anything else in its genre.
… A legal system that doesn’t distinguish between leaks to the press in the public interest and treason against the nation will not only produce unjust results, but will deprive the public of critical information that is necessary for democratic accountability.
This is a sad day for Bradley Manning, but it’s also a sad day for all Americans who depend on brave whistleblowers and a free press for a fully informed public debate.
This year came the army to Reading in Wessex; and in the course of three nights after rode two earls up, who were met by Alderman Ethelwulf at Englefield; where he fought with them, and obtained the victory.
There one of them was slain, whose name was Sidrac.

a voice of uncommon power, sweetness, extent, and agility On his arrival here, at the first private rehearsal at Cuzzoni's apartments, Lord Cooper, then the principal manager of the opera under Porpora, observing that the band did not follow him, but were all gaping with wonder, as if thunder-struck, desired them to be attentive; when they all confessed, that they were unable to keep pace with him, having not only been disabled by astonishment, but overpowered by his talents.
There was none of all Farinelli's excellencies by which he so far surpassed all other singers, and astonished the public, as his messa di voce, or swell; which, by the natural formation of his lungs, and artificial economy of breath, he was able to protract to such a length as to excite incredulity even in those who heard him; who, though unable to detect the artifice, imagined him to have had the latent help of some instrument by which the tone was continued, while he renewed his powers by respiration.

I went there with the very first ship, with the first Governor, Captain Stirling.
I had on my staff only one assistant surveyor, and what could be done with one assistant, with the whole of the townships to be fixed upon and surveyed, the country to be examined, the settlers located, the harbours to be surveyed, c. c.?
It was perfectly impossible to do more than we did. Everything that could be done was done, but it was insufficient to place the people on their lands in time to prevent their sustaining very great losses.
We took an oath to defend the security and the welfare of the state of Israel.

Jürgen had a flattened-down hairstyle with a fringe in the front, which we rather took to.

Too many people here and in England hold the view that the German people as a whole are not responsible for what has taken place – that only a few Nazis are responsible.
That unfortunately is not based on fact.
The German people must have it driven home to them that the whole nation has been engaged in a lawless conspiracy against the decencies of modern civilization.
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
James Dean died when he was 24.

Everyone can understand the feelings and the relationship described in the song, so why does it matter if Dylan wrote it with one woman in mind?
A throwback to an earlier era of cop shows when steel-edged realism was still novel and there was a thrill to watching terse, streetwise detectives on shows like Dragnet and Kojak cajole witnesses and browbeat suspects.

In its earlier incarnation, the film was a flawed masterpiece; in Scott’s restored version, it is, quite simply, a masterpiece.
3D Land is a grabby borrower of a game — enemies from Mario 3, music from 2006′s New Super Mario Bros., gameplay from Galaxy.
Eventually it starts borrowing from itself.
It’s an excellent game because all of these things work so well together; the only thing keeping it from perfection is that it cries out for more innovations to call its own.

But, the rate of increase being continually accelerated, it becomes in some time so rapid, as to mock all the powers of the imagination. – One penny, put out at our Saviour’s birth to 5 per cent, compound interest, would, before this time, have increased to a greater sum, than would be contained in a hundred and fifty millions of earths, all solid gold.
But if put out to simple interest, it would, in the same time, have amounted to no more than seven shillings and four pence half-penny.
If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes.
But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is an intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense.
If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.
Plan for social security : XI. Medical treatment covering all requirements will be provided for all citizens by a National Health Service organised under the health departments and post-medical rehabilitation treatment will be provided for all persons capable of profiting by it.
The core of the belief in progress is that human values and goals converge in parallel with our increasing knowledge.
The twentieth century shows the contrary.
Human beings use the power of scientific knowledge to assert and defend the values and goals they already have.
New technologies can be used to alleviate suffering and enhance freedom.
They can, and will, also be used to wage war and strengthen tyranny.
Science made possible the technologies that powered the industrial revolution.
In the twentieth century, these technologies were used to implement state terror and genocide on an unprecedented scale.

This bold combination of engineering, architecture, public art and landscape design, which reprises the alliance that built the triumphant 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, propels the city into the new millennium - a definitive moment in the architectural revival that has replaced the timid traditionalism of the mid-1990s with the bold modernism of today.

It took a lot of courage for him to befriend me in front of Hitler.
You can melt down all the medals and cups I have and they wouldn't be a plating on the 24-karat friendship I felt for Luz Long at that moment.

The sad part of the story is I never saw Long again.

I've done something new for this fight.
I've wrestled with an alligator, I've tussled with a whale, I did handcuff lightning, and threw thunder in jail.

But today our emphasis is on freedoms ...
The future now depends on what the people want, not what a few politicians or religious leaders prefer.
Leaders in all ruling classes should be checked by the people .... there are - and should be - many different interpretations of Islam.

It isn't a great series, and does not stand as Gainax's best effort since Neon Genesis Evangelion, but it is a better one than it might appear to be at first.
This Society was incorporated for the purpose of promoting artistic work in all branches of handicraft.
It hopes to bring Designers and Workmen into mutually helpful relations, and to encourage workmen to execute designs of their own. It endeavors to stimulate in workmen an appreciation of the dignity and value of good design; to counteract the popular impatience of Law and Form, and the desire for over-ornamentation and specious originality.
It will insist upon the necessity of sobriety and restraint, or ordered arrangement, of due regard for the relation between the form of an object and its use, and of harmony and fitness in the decoration put upon it.
He signed my poster ‘To Scotty, the big bad voodoo daddy’.
I thought it was the coolest name I ever heard on one of the coolest musical nights I ever had.
So when it came time to name this band, I didn’t really have a choice. I felt like it was handed down to me.
I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description ; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so.
But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.
That’s part of who I am but I’m not as self-destructive as I used to be.
I’ve done it so I’m not curious about it.
Of course I consider marriage.
But I’ve considered my career longer.
If I were to quit now to get married – and I’d have to quit because marriage is a full-time job to my way of thinking – then I’m afraid that all the rest of my life I’d be fretting about what a great actress I might have been.
It was definitely no drugs, because we were to young, and we weren't really into that.

Sir Karl Popper is not really a participant in the contemporary professional philosophical dialogue; quite the contrary, he has ruined that dialogue.
If he is on the right track, then the majority of professional philosophers the world over have wasted or are wasting their intellectual careers.
The gulf between Popper’s way of doing philosophy and that of the bulk of contemporary professional philosophers is as great as that between astronomy and astrology.

Money rents you insulation / Tenderness asphyxiates you / Somenone else’s flesh to borrow / Sling it from your bed tomorrow / Live too fast for love or sorrow / Look behind the face, it’s hollow.
Our concept is “Children create the world.” Adults, who are moving the world and society now, all started out as children.
As we grow up, we tend to justify escaping or compromising by making excuses. In a pure way, we want to deliver the thoughts we had as children to create a wonderful world.
Yet these men came, though but in remorse; they saw his plays, though but to dislike; they spoke his name, though but in slander.
The spoken word revolution is led a lot by women and by poets of color.

Scrutiny of the narrative structure and the presentation of character in Sinuhe does identify considerable complexity, analogous with the richness of the text in style and vocabulary; it also brings out the relationship of the text with Egyptian values.
Techniques of analysis that are applied to western literature seem to yield results with Sinuhe, but reveal alien preoccupations and emphases, as is only to be expected.
Such analyses do not seek to discover a single, correct understanding or author's intention in a text, but to deepen our comprehension of its meaning.
Leech Barometer: Take an eight-ounce phial, and put in it three gills of water, and place in it a healthy leech, changing the water in summer once a week, and in winter once a fortnight, and it will most accurately prognosticate the weather.
If the weather is to be fine, the leech lies motionless at the bottom of the glass, and coiled together in a spiral form; if rain may be expected, it will creep up to the top of its lodgings, and remain there till the weather is settled; if we are to have wind, it will move through its habitation with amazing swiftness, and seldom goes to rest till it begins to blow hard; if a remarkable storm of thunder and rain is to succeed, it will lodge for some days before almost continually out of the water, and discover great uneasiness in violent throes and convulsive-like motions; in frost as in clear summer-like weather it lies constantly at the bottom; and in snow as in rainy weather it pitches its dwelling in the very mouth of the phial.

Numerous scientists have pointed out the irony that right at the historical moment when we have the technologies to permit worldwide availability and distributed process of scientific data, broadening collaboration and accelerating the pace and depth of discovery we are busy locking up that data and preventing the use of correspondingly advanced technologies on knowledge.

Such activities do not raise antitrust concern.
Though coordinated with or among members, they do not relate to members’ market activities. “Joint lobbying” is no antitrust offence.

By raising the price of bread corn, thus, far from making the people live less on that necessary, as so many, who have not thoroughly considered the matter, imagine, we force them to live more on it; and beyond a certain price, almost entirely.
However, paradoxical, therefore, it may be in seeming, it is a plain substantial fact, that the higher price of corn and potatoes, the greater is the consumption “

During all the years we were together, I was rarely away from Esther, even for a day.
In all my undertakings, her help and sympathey and encouragement were my inspiration.
Added to this was a rare comradeship that made life very beautiful.
And so I find it most dificult to bear up under the great sense of loss.
Her wish has always been that I carry on no matter what happened.
I wanted to show the people I was a good goalkeeper and a good German and things went my way that day.

If you're looking for IRC clients you're spoilt for choice with many distributions, as there are plenty to choose from.
Some are text-based (IRSSI), some integrate well with instant messenger applications (Pidgin) while others are simply IRC clients through and through.

...conditions of Columbia Road when the parks system was being established precluded this vision from becoming a reality.
When Columbia Road was formally designed in the late 1800s, there was already a relatively high density of buildings.
The road had street rails that were used by a streetcar trolley connecting Uphams Corner and Franklin Park.
There was a grass strip in the center and roads on either side, one for commercial traffic and the other for pleasure traffic.
As a result, Columbia Road failed to serve the purposes of either the businesses or the pleasure travelers well, and there was not enough room for what Olmsted considered a proper parkway.

For in those days the Númenóreans were far-sighted; yet even so it was only the keenest eyes among them that could see this vision, from the Meneltarma maybe, or from some tall ship that lay off their western coast… .

Only in Bambi the tears linger.
In spite of humor, beauty and charm, even a lifetime does not diminish the memory of the shot that killed Bambi’s mother and the anguish felt for the lonely little deer.
Love’s first kiss or the wave of a Blue Fairy’s wand could not undo this terrible moment.
It’s reality and truth were the story’s strength and the prime ingredient in making Bambi such a different picture.

Overall: This was an utterly mind-blowing album which made me wonder about how well this band blends funk, metal, hip-hop, and punk rock to make it their own unique sound.
The chief arguments of the advocates of the Na-Dene theory is that the morphological systems of Tlingit, Eyak, and the Athapaskan languages, and to a lesser extent also of Haida, show conspicuous morphological similarities and common features which justify the assumption that they belong to a larger unit.
There is however a powerful argument against the genetic relationship.
These four groups have very few words in common.
A glance at their so-called basic vocabularies and the morphemes in their grammatical systems shows enormous differences which seem to preclude any possibility of genetic relationship.
On the other hand their morphological systems reveal close similarities which cannot possibly be the work of chance.
The only way out of this dilemma has been to suppose that borrowing from one language to another took place.

One of the most interesting sights in Erzerum is the Sanassarian College, founded and handsomely endowed by the liberality of an Armenian merchant.
The fine buildings are of the best construction, and are admirably suited for educational purposes, and the equipments are of the latest and most complete description.
The education and the moral and intellectual training are of a very high type, and the personal influence of the three directors, who were educated in Germany and England, altogether "makes for righteousness."
The graduation course is nine years.
The students, numbering 120, wear a uniform, and there is no distinction of class among them.
They are, almost without exception, manly, earnest, and studious, and are full of enthusiasm and esprit de corps.
Much may be hoped for in the future from the admirable moral training and thorough education given in this college, which is one of the few bright spots in Armenia.

Should the trolley-line be made through the steep, narrow and tortous streets of the town I should find myself entirely cut off from my present railway-station and base of supplies; for no man who has had experience of trollies and their workings would willingly risk the lives of his family or his horses by exposing them to the daily chances of accident from direct collision with the cars, from fallen wires or from runaways. ...

He produced thirty operas between the year 1721 and 1740; yet, after the dissolution of the Academy, in 1729, none were attended with the success that war due to their intrinsic and superior merit, though some of the best were posterior to the period.

There are, broadly speaking, two types of drinkers.
There is the man whom we all know, stupid, unimaginative, whose brain is bitten numbly by numb maggots; who walks generously with wide-spread, tentative legs, falls frequently in the gutter, and who sees, in the extremity of his ecstasy, blue mice and pink elephants.

"The Art of Video Games," a technologically impressive but intellectually inert exhibition at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, belongs in a history or technology museum, not in an institution devoted to art.

Thought, argues Nørretranders, is in fact a process of chucking away information, and it is this detritus (happily labelled exformation) that is crucially involved in automatic behaviours of expertise (riding a bicycle, playing the piano), and which is therefore the most precious to us as people.
James Herriot, a British veterinary surgeon, is one of those rare men who know how to appreciate the ordinary … He’s a veterinarian, that’s what he is, and when his right arm is free, he’s a helluva writer as well.
And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make.
I don't think anybody, certainly not myself, realised what a toll Sydney took on me.
It was wonderful, marvellous, the pinnacle of my career.
But it was also incredibly traumatic.
More traumatic than I allowed myself to feel at the time and slowly but surely I have come to realise that I could not go through all that again.And realistically, to win a gold medal in my own country, having lit the Olympic flame, there was never going to be a moment for an athlete finer than that.And climaxing with that night in the Sydney Olympic Stadium when I won the 400 metres and then just sat there on the track, hardly daring to open the window in my mind that would let me experience all the feelings that were fighting to get in my head.
I don't think I ever really did open the window fully.
I had to choose.
Choose between the win and lose.
But what's the use?
The poor operas I doubt go on but badly, for tho’ every body praises both Cafferielli and the opera yet it has never been full, and if it is not now at first it will be very empty towards the latter end of the winter
Now that the decentralized system for finding peers is so well developed, TPB has decided that there is no need to run a tracker anymore, so it will remain down!
It’s the end of an era, but the era is no longer up2date.
Because it goes beyond what Magma used to be without lessening the impact of what the music used to be, K.A. stands as one of the biggest surprises of 2004 and a must-have for fans and newcomers alike.
The truth was, it was still Star Trek, and I think there were things I wanted to do with Voyager that I could never really accomplish.
I couldn’t do those things until I went to Battlestar.
I don’t know that I really could have done that at Star Trek, because the show was not designed to tell that kind of story and it really would have flown in the face of a lot of things Gene had set up and that he had said were important to him.
So I think I probably had somewhat unrealistic goals of where I wanted to go , but then I found an opportunity to do them on Battlestar.
In Zukunft werden Sie Nixon nicht mehr herumschubsen können, weil das, meine Herren, meine letzte Pressekonferenz ist.
… leads us to believe that recovery is sound only if it does come of itself.
For any revival which is merely due to artificial stimulus leaves part of the work of depressions undone and adds, to an undigested remnant of maladjustment, new maladjustment of its own which has to be liquidated in turn, thus threatening business with another crisis ahead.

I think it is the best he ever made, but I have thought so of so many, that I will not say positively ‘tis the finest, but ‘tis so fine I have not words to describe it Whilst Mr. Handel was playing his part, I could not help thinking of him a necromancer in the midst of his own enchantments.
the issue before the House is not whether the appellants' conduct is morally right, but whether it is properly charged under the Act of 1861.
When proposing that the conduct is not rightly so charged I do not invite your Lordships' House to endorse it as morally acceptable.
What I do say is that these are questions of private morality; that the standards by which they fall to be judged are not those of the criminal law; and that if these standards are to be upheld the individual must enforce them upon himself according to his own moral standards,
And Thou knowest O Lord, that when Thou didst decide that the Confederacy should not succeed, Thou hadst first to remove Thy servant, Stonewall Jackson.
There's certainly even less worth keeping on both the bubble-brained 'Stepping into Tomorrow' and the soupy 'Places and Spaces'
I said all week turnovers would be the key and they were for .
As a quarterback you want to make sure you take care of the ball — turnovers kill you.
He is not welcome here.
As we came together, we will also go together
It basically encompasses everything.
Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life: Don't judge me.
Everything that you think that you know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about your own life, might not be the case.
So I think it's just openmindedness and just be cool.
Insect-borne diseases are not diseases of climate but of poverty.
a pattern of basic assumptions – invented, discovered, or developed by a given group as it learns to cope with its problems of external adaption and internal integration – that has worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems
Ismar Boas.
How many readers recognize the name?
There was a time, when the reputation of this great physician spanned the continents, for he was a pioneer and founder of the medical subspeciality of Gastroenterology.
Every physician today understands the importance of finding occult blood in the stool.
Yet, how many know that Boas in 1901 first gave clinical meaning to that concept?
For us, we just try to keep it simple.
We're obviously a band; that's really all we ever wanted to be from the very beginning without catering to any particular genre or political or religious agenda.
We just want to make music with no barriers.
Doc was a dentist whom necessity had made a gambler; a gentleman whom disease had made a frontier vagabond; a philosopher whom life had made a caustic wit; a long lean ash-blond fellow nearly dead with consumption, and at the same time the most skillful gambler and the nerviest, speediest, deadliest man with a gun that I ever knew.
The game never matches its inspirations in terms of design — don't expect Zelda quality puzzles, for example — but it captures their feel surprisingly well.
Our friendship.
That's the difference between Winger and so many other bands.
We're all really good friends.
Not only are the guys super musicians and so good at their craft, but they're also really cool people.
It's great to be up there doing it as a team.
Do you support continuation of the reform process which the State President began on 2 February 1990 and which is aimed at a new Constitution through negotiation?
There was a tsunami and there are terrible natural disasters, because there isn’t enough Torah study … Black people reside there .
Blacks will study the Torah? , Let’s bring a tsunami and drown them … Hundreds of thousands remained homeless.
Tens of thousands have been killed.
All of this because they have no God … Bush was behind the Gush Katif, he encouraged Sharon to expel Gush Katif … We had 15,000 people expelled here , and there 150,000 .
It was God’s retribution.
God does not short-change anyone.

Both parties will whip their Parliamentary Parties in both Houses to support a simple majority referendum on the Alternative Vote, without prejudice to the positions parties will take during such a referendum.
I thought it was kinda neat that you had the whole record on one side of a cassette.
You could listen to it, flip it over, and play it again.

This isn’t a game that will provide you hours of solo enjoyment on a rainy Sunday afternoon, and if you’re expecting a full-featured music game on par with Rock Band or Guitar Hero, I’d advice against picking up Lips.
For hardcore gamers, there’s nothing even remotely challenging about Lips
U.S. nuclear forces must be capable of, and be seen to be capable of, destroying those critical war-making and war-supporting assets and capabilities that a potential enemy leadership values most and that it would rely on to achieve its own objectives in a post-war world.

You will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over the oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.
The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeat in open battle man to man.
Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground.
Our home fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men.
The tide has turned.
The free men of the world are marching together to victory.
I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle.
We will accept nothing less than full victory.
Good luck, and let us all beseech the blessings of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.
Great fatigue and disappointment, affected him so much, that he was this Spring (1737) struck with the Palsy, which took entirely away, the use of 4 fingers of his right hand; and totally disabled him from Playing: And when the heats of the Summer 1737 came on, the Disorder seemed at times to affect his Understanding.
At the time we did the first record – which I really like and think is good – you can tell the band was really young.
We’d been playing most of those songs for quite a while, and we were just so happy to be making a record that we didn’t really think a whole lot about making the songs better.
Go's dramatic trajectory may be a fairly well travelled one, but in its stronger moments, such as the romantic interplay between Kubozuka and Shibasaki, it's undeniably affecting, and as such, one of the most outstandingly compelling and thought-provoking films of its year.
By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States and as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, I have today awarded the Presidential Unit Citation (Navy) for extraordinary heroism to USS Midway (CVA-41) and Attack Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) for extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty in action against enemy forces in Southeast Asia from 30 April 1972 to 9 February 1973.
During this crucial period of the Vietnam conflict, USS Midway and embarked Attack Carrier Air Wing Five carried out devastating aerial attacks against enemy installations, transportation, and lines of communications in the face of extremely heavy opposition including multi-calibre antiaircraft artillery fire and surface-to-air missiles.
Displaying superb airmanship and unwavering courage, Midway/CVW-5 pilots played a significant role in lifting the prolonged sieges at An Loc, Kontum, and Quang Tri and in carrying out the concentrated aerial strikes against the enemy's industrial heartland which eventually resulted in a cease-fire.
By their excellent teamwork, dedication, and sustained superior performance, the officers and men of Midway and Attack Carrier Air Wing Five reflected great credit upon themselves and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.
And it is a wonder what will be the fashion after the plague is done as to periwigs, for nobody will dare to buy any haire for fear of the infection – that it had been cut off of the heads of people dead of the plague.
I did it because I had a grudge against him.
He deserved it. He was the real culprit.
He wanted to crush the spirit of my people, so I have crushed him.
For full 21 years, I have been trying to wreak vengeance.
I am happy that I have done the job.
I am not scared of death.
I am dying for my country.
I have seen my people starving in India under the British rule.
I have protested against this, it was my duty.
What a greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the sake of my motherland?
We are credibly inform’d that one Day last Week Mr. H–d–l, Director-General of the Opera-House, sent a Message to Signior Senesino, the famous Italian Singer, acquainting Him that He had no farther Occasion for his Service; and that Senesino reply’d the next Day by a Letter, containing a full Resignation of all his Parts in the Opera, which He had perform’d for many Years with great Applause.
it’s not mentioned enough that she does more than enough with what she’s got.
She never leaves her voice hanging in spotlit scarcity, folding it variegated terracing, whispering out the lead track, shouting in the back-up, and piling each song with enough interlocking sounds to create the tightly packed illusion of vocal massiveness.
The promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms must be considered as a priority objective of the United Nations in accordance with its purposes and principles, in particular the purpose of international cooperation.

Full of surprises, this Label Bleu CD has lapsed from print and is becoming increasingly difficult to find.
Outlined against a blue-gray October sky, the Four Horsemen rode again.
In dramatic lore their names are Death, Destruction, Pestilence, and Famine.

Their real names are: Stuhldreher, Crowley, Miller and Layden.
They formed the crest of the South Bend cyclone before which another fighting Army team was swept over the precipice at the Polo Grounds this afternoon as 55,000 spectators peered down upon the bewildering panorama spread out upon the green plain below.
I think it’s her next sexy video.
It’s a very simple video for her She’s so sweet and funny and so normal and down to earth.
It’s really fun as a director to see her in front of the camera.
She’s so creative with this stuff.
The video is very simple, it’s very, very minimal.
So it’s her, her, her.
And she’s totally engaging every second.
She really knows how to work with a camera and move.
I was really impressed, and I have worked almost with every female artist in the business.

The activities, rituals and personalities of the world of organized crime have been deeply romanticized in the popular media over the past 30 years.
However, this trial, like so many trials before it, has portrayed the true nature of organized crime.
For The Desolation of Smaug, Shore honed the themes introduced in An Unexpected Journey and amped up the darkness and bombast, introducing a memorable new cue to accompany the arrival of the film's scaly antagonist.

Drink is the curse of the working classes.

There are parts of Lost Odyssey that are simply gorgeous.
Some of the locations are rendered with amazing detail as are all of the playable characters.
These stand out in stark contrast to a few locations that look, by comparison, unfinished.
Gameplay outside of combat feels sluggishly paced to the point of boredom.
The religion of the papists is superstitious and idolatrous; their faith and doctrine erroneous and heretical; their church apostatical; to give them therefore a toleration, or to consent that they may freely exercise their religion is a grievous sin.

He was a superb officer in that position, hard and tough worker, and he demanded much, always insisting that anything you ask the troops to do, you must be able to do yourself.
What are the two things that can be seen from outer space? The Great Wall of China and the panel gaps of a Bristol.
Game On manages to highlight the ever deteriorating boundaries that exist between genres, as film, music, gaming and art all overlap to create a hybrid of unimaginable proportions and without limits.
Sometimes the pain is too much to examine, or even tolerate… That doesn’t make it evil, though – or necessarily dangerous.
But people fear death even more than pain.
It’s strange that they fear death.
Life hurts a lot more than death.
At the point of death, the pain is over.
Yeah – I guess it is a friend…
I formed my first band at eleven, I called it Reality.
When I turned 15, I decided to change, because I did not the same as in the age of 11. I tried to come up with a new band name.
It was during a math lesson, I was writing band names. I wrote Pain of Salvation and it stuck.
I showed it to my classmate, who later became a member of the band, he said too long, nobody would remember that!
"His students – gone forth from the classroom, and radiated over the country and to far corners of the world... all bear in the secret structure of their minds the impress of Professor Blyth’s teaching, and will cherish through life, with reverence and affection, the memory of their teacher and friend."
Sanitarium is a damn good story.
It may end a bit rough and take a while to get going, but I struggle to think of many game narratives of its caliber.
By relying on 3D as an important mechanic rather than a second thought to enhance the visuals, the developers achieved the most effective 3D I’ve ever seen in any medium, as well as the most brilliant use of it.
From the clever platforming puzzles to the creative level design, every aspect of the game is heightened by the masterful use of an effect that up until now has essentially only been used as an optional visual boost.
And it wasn’t to around 1986 that I decided I should… that somehow it had become my career.
And I should – learn.
But… Can it be a need?
It is at this point a need.
But it could change, you know.
I need to do it, um, I don’t know why but I feel the need to do it.
I feel the need to create right now.
I wanted to tell all of you out there … that after listening to my heart and my gut, two things that have served me pretty well in the past, I’ve decided I’ll be leaving Today at the end of May.
I really feel as if we’ve become friends through the years.
Sometimes I think change is a good thing, although it may be terrifying to get out of your comfort zone, it’s very exciting to start a new chapter in your life
Design management is a complex and multi-faceted activity that goes right to the heart of what a company is or does it is not something susceptible to pat formulas, a few bullet points or a manual.
Every company’s structure and internal culture is different; design management is no exception.
But the fact that every firm is different does not diminish the importance of managing design tightly and effectively.

Dave has an amazing studio not too far from his home, in the Valley, and it's a great, kick-ass studio, but I think he felt that if he went in there, what would he do different on this record?
They'd be recording in the same room, using the same board, getting the same sort of vibe.
Nine years ago today, Milosevic's fiery speech here to a million angry Serbs was a rallying cry for nationalism and boosted his popularity enough to make him the country's uncontested leader.
I hope on the next annuel Exhibition that you will shine as a Portrait Painter – for as i have always said, if you could have confidence in yourself, and paint portraits with the same exactness of finish as you have done in still life, that no Artist could be your superior in that line.
It's like the drums are playing a big rock song and the guitars are playing a gentle folk song.
And it's got one of the most upbeat choruses of any Zeppelin song, even though the words are so dark.
For now we see through a glass darkly; but then, face to face: now I know in part; but then I shall know even as I am known.
I doubt operas will not survive longer than this winter, they are now at their last gasp; the subscription is expired and nobody will renew it.
The directors are all squabbling, and they have so many divisions among themselves that I wonder they have not broke up before. Senesino goes away next winter, and I believe Faustina, so you see harmony is almost out of fashion.
A slight piece of propaganda, put together with all of Eisenstein‘s magnificent cinematic resources: the cream separator demonstration is one of the most famous montage sequences in cinema history.
More dreadful looking fellows than Napoleon's Guard I have never seen.
They had the look of thoroughbred, veteran, disciplined banditti.
Depravity, recklessness, and bloodthirstiness were burned into their faces Black mustachios, gigantic bearskins, and a ferocious expression were their characteristics.
The one thing I was dreading was that the last album would be on my shoulder the whole time I made this one, but it wasn’t—it was flushed out really quickly.
I’m not haunted by that time.
My experience 14 years ago was completely different from now.
pornography: licentious painting employed to decorate the walls of rooms sacred to Bacchanalian orgies, examples of which exist in Pompeii.
The Hour will not come until you fight the Jews.
The Jews will hide behind stones or trees.
Then the stones or trees will call: Oh Muslim, servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.
At one time kings were anointed by Deity, so the problem was to see to it that Deity chose the right candidate.
In this age the myth is 'the will of the people' ... but the problem changes only superficially.
There is absolutely no reason for a record like this to be published … It has no place in our society.
They were at the very bottom rung of biker gangs.
Some were in their 40s but still lived with their parents.
They were not making any money, many of them had been rejected by the Hells Angels and half of them didn't even own a motorbike.
Some countries have seen the use of systematic sexual violence against women as a s weapon of war to degrade and humiliate entire populations.
Rape is the most despicable crime against women: mass rape is an abomination.
It is a symptom of the unrestrained and vicious new form of warfare which is appearing in the wake of the cold war.
The operating principle of Futurama was that you can do a joke that 1 percent of the audience gets, as long as it doesn't derail the enjoyment of the mass audience.
And that 1 percent becomes a fan for life.
Time has done nothing to diminish the quality of one of the finest debut albums ever recorded.
There's an urgency and enthusiasm about their performance that retains timeless charm.
The nine cuts offer a tour de force of powerful yet often subtle dynamics.
And let's not forget the fact that with this album, Page virtually invents the guitar riff as a key songwriting component.
You take a bite.
It doesn't seem so bad, and then it builds and it builds and it builds.
So it is quite nasty.
Any attempt to categorise defences as justifications or excuses would, in the present state of the law, be premature.
There is no highlight on this recording or the other four recordings that resulted from these two sessions.
They are collectively the highlight of the first phase of the first great Miles Davis Quintet, captured here more crisply and accurately than on any previous release of this music.
The content of the current Documenta, and the ways in which the art is displayed and framed by argument, gives pause for serious concern.
Documenta 12 is a disaster.
I tried hard to have a father, but instead I had a dad.
I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore.
There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before.
I was responsible for developing all of the DNA extraction techniques and demonstrating that it was possible after all to obtain DNA profiles from old stains.
The biggest achievement was developing the preferential extraction method to separate sperm from vaginal cells – without this method it would have been difficult to use DNA in rape cases.
When we were in the air, we really didn't know what was going on.
All we heard was security measures and we were diverted.
That was all we knew…
… mad and wicked enough to Publish a Pamphlet evidently in defence of Sodomy, advertised in all the papers.
This was rather overlooked than tolerated — What was the consequence?
Why, it is at this instant so thoroughly forgot that few I believe know that ever such a Pamphlet existed.
The dependency structure between packages must be a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
That is, there must be no cycles in the dependency structure.
The Beatles exercise the combination of musical naivety with electronic sophistication which suits their engaging, irreverent cheerfulness and the loudest common chords since the end of Ein Heldenleben
The present work deduces the entire corpus of economics from a few simple and apodictically true axioms: the Fundamental Axiom of action—that men employ means to achieve ends, and two subsidiary postulates: that there is a variety of human and natural resources, and that leisure is a consumer’s good.
Among the chieftains who battled against the Anglo-Norman power his place will always be high, if not indeed the highest of all, for no man ever made better or more judicious use of the native force of the Welsh people for adequate national ends; his patriotic statemanship will always entitle him to wear the proud style of Llywelyn the Great.
It’s only in the last 24 hours that I’m realising how much I created situations that put people under enormous pressure.
I wasn’t being responsible enough to be aware of it, and that’s my fault entirely.
I want to be clear that I’m not blaming this on my lack of awareness or knowledge of consent and boundaries.
I’m blaming myself.
I’m deeply, deeply ashamed of this.
The premise has a lot of possibilities.
Before it aired, I was at a convention in Pasadena, and Sternbach and Okuda were on stage, and they were answering questions from the audience about the new ship.
It was all very technical, and they were talking about the fact that in the premise this ship was going to have problems.
It wasn’t going to have unlimited sources of energy.
It wasn’t going to have all the doodads of the Enterprise.
It was going to be rougher, fending for themselves more, having to trade to get supplies that they want.
That didn’t happen.
It doesn’t happen at all, and it’s a lie to the audience.
I think the audience intuitively knows when something is true and something is not true.
Voyager is not true.
If it were true, the ship would not look spic-and-span every week, after all these battles it goes through.
How many times has the bridge been destroyed?
How many shuttlecrafts have vanished, and another one just comes out of the oven?
That kind of bullshitting the audience I think takes its toll.
At some point the audience stops taking it seriously, because they know that this is not really the way this would happen.
These people wouldn’t act like this.
Remember We will not tolerate any longer Free the political prisoners or it will be sure death for all of you
I gained a whole new audience thanks to Peel.
Much to the amazement of my older fans, who find themselves among 16-to-35s in theatres, and wonder where they come from.
There were so many things that represented my addictions and eating disorders and self-harm.
When I'm unraveling this black fabric...It was the toxicity took over my mind for so long, that oozed out of every pore that I had because I was suffering inside...I'm taking it off and walking on broken glass and powering through it.
Some people ask us if this is a cult.
I say this: It's something special.
It's not for everyone – it's only for those who understand.
The big benefit of it (apart from that it's BSD licensed, for license geeks :-) is that it is fast, 5-10 times faster than gcc, while still producing reasonable code … it is also quite simple to port.
Why, we have gotten into a mess, a quagmire from which each fresh step renders the difficulty of extrication immensely greater.
I'm sure I wish I could see what we were getting out of it, and all it means to us as a nation.

The biographical articles in this work include the names of all persons of any importance which occur in the Greek and Roman writers, from the earliest times down to the extinction of the Western Empire in the year 476 of our era, and to the extinction of the Eastern Empire by the capture of Constantinople by the turks in the year 1453.
During the nineties and even at the end of the nineties, there were very few bands.
We had Waylander from Ireland. And one or two in Europe, but it was very rare to get a real folk metal band.
Nowadays it is a bit of an explosion all over the place.
That was the first time I had been in the studio with a producer like David Foster, My voice wasn't as developed as it is now and the song required what producers call ‘money notes' - the kind that get you a No. 1 on the charts!
I was really nervous but it all worked just fine
For our last number I’d like to ask your help: Would the people in the cheaper seats clap your hands?
And the rest of you, if you’ll just rattle your jewellery!
The Pilgrims and the Puritans came to America seeking religious freedom for themselves.
Roger Williams arrived seeking liberty of conscience for all: Protestant and Catholic, Jew and Muslim, unbeliever and pagan.
The fiery and pitiless angel, holding the fire in his hand, is the archangel Puruel, who has power over fire, and tries the works of men through fire, and if the fire consume the work of any man, the angel of judgment immediately seizes him, and carries him away to the place of sinners, a most bitter place of punishment.
The shooting lasted for several days.
There were people killed in Suez on 25 January.
Neither the president nor the interior minister ordered any kind of investigation.
Then killings happened in other cities.
No investigation was conducted ...
They did not interfere to stop it or hold accountable those who fired live rounds; this confirmed their involvement in responsibility.
He was a great unifier and a very, very special man in this regard beyond everything else he did.
This emphasis on reconciliation was his biggest legacy.
We got it done and I don’t know that Kurt was around to approve it or not.
I think it might just have been shot to management to approve or something.
Believing that true love waits, I make a commitment to God, myself, my family, my friends, my future mate, and my future children to be sexually abstinent from this day until the day I enter a biblical marriage relationship.
‘A Streetcar Named Marge’ is just about perfect, a stunningly assured and consistently hilarious marriage of scathing pop-culture and domestic satire and emotion.
By this point, The Simpsons was operating on a higher evolutionary plane than any other comedy on television and its fourth season had only begun.
dear reader, THE PARIS REVIEW hopes to emphasize creative work – fiction and poetry – not to the exclusion of criticism, but with the aim in mind of merely removing criticism from the dominating place it holds in most literary magazines and putting it pretty much where it belongs, i.e., somewhere near the back of the book.
I think THE PARIS REVIEW should welcome these people into its pages – the good writers and good poets, the non-drumbeaters and non-axe-grinders.

RPG gamers may lament at the fact that it has a shallow story line, or that it isn't RPG enough...but there's little argument that Action/RPGs translate very well on handheld consoles.
And in that respect, Final Fantasy Adventure sits nicely in a respectable position behind The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening as a top Action/RPG title for the Game Boy.
Tom Hall's epic RPG was bursting with lough-out-loud, throwaway dialogue and cut-scenes that, as in the best LucasArts adventures, had nothing to do with the story but everything to do with keeping us entertained.
A classy exit for gaming's favorite whipping boys.
Far from a celebration of the power of our power sources, the lyrics drive home the need for a renewable energy source, some alternative to the fossil fuels we're permanently expending by the second, and a future of abundant electricity free from environmental depletion.

Blade Runner embodies a number of the recurring themes in Dick’s writings: the restless paranoia of the characters, the dismissive influence of a higher authority, the substitution of reality by fakes and imitations, the self-perpetuating increase of garbage and waste.
It is this element of action and timing – not any puzzles – that makes Blade Runner truly challenging.
For this reason, and for the incredible re-creation of the mood and atmosphere of the 1982 film, newcomers and experienced adventurers alike will find the game a compelling and unique experience.
From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an Iron Curtain has descended across the Continent.
Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe.
Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow.

so far forgot himself in the heat of the conquest, as to stick his sword into one of the pasteboard stones of the wall of the town, and bore it in triumph before him
Its kernel, interestingly, is also in Wimberly, who quotes the Breton song of „Le Seigneur Nann et la Fee“, about a childless lord who gets a fertility potion from a witch and promises her her own reward; later she leads him into the woods in the shape of a white hart, only to reveal herself and demand his love as payment.

That's the thing with an album: you spend a big chunk of your life making it and you think about every note, bleep, squeak and crackle.
I felt that it made a nice contrast to the metal shredding fiddle album, "Unlaced", and there was really nothing I could do that was more at the polar end of things.
I also loved that it was the perfect representation of "then" versus "now".
The legislation crystallizes the commitment of the United States to help bring an end to the brutality and destruction that have been a hallmark of the LRA across several countries for two decades, and to pursue a future of greater security and hope for the people of central Africa.

The security of our imperial interests in the Far East lies ultimately in our ability to control sea communications in the south-western Pacific, for which purpose adequate fleet must be based at Singapore.
Since our previous assurances in this respect, however, the whole strategic situation has been radically altered by the French defeat.
The result of this has been to alter the whole of the balance of naval strength in home waters.
Formerly we were prepared to abandon the Eastern Mediterranean and dispatch a fleet to the Far East, relying on the French fleet in the Western Mediterranean to contain the Italian fleet.
Now if we move the Mediterranean fleet to the Far East there is nothing to contain the Italian fleet, which will be free to operate in the Atlantic or reinforce the German fleet in home waters, using bases in north-west France.
We must therefore retain in European waters sufficient naval forces to watch both the German and Italian fleets, and we cannot do this and send a fleet to the Far East.
In the meantime the strategic importance to us of the Far East both for Empire security and to enable us to defeat the enemy by control of essential commodities at the source has been increased.
Can more be necessary to demonstrate the inadmissibility of such a doctrine than that it puts it in the power of 1/4 of the U. S. — that is, of 7 States out of 24 — to give the law and even the Constn. to 17 States That the 7 might, in particular instances be right and the 17 wrong, is more than possible.
But to establish a positive & permanent rule giving such a power to such a minority over such a majority, would overturn the first principle of free Govt

Handel’s return to the military heroic type of libretto, last addressed in Sosarme, after his fruitful incursions into the worlds of Ariosto and classical myth in the five intervening operas, elicited a weak response.
Old stock devices like the business with the sword and cup of poison in Act III (compare Floridante, Tolomeo and Lotario) no longer inspired exciting music.
Much of the score is reminiscent of things he had said better elsewhere.
In most of Act I and the latter part of Act III he seems merely to be going through the motions. This is reflected in the comparative weakness of the characterisation, the element in which so many of his operas from Agrippina to Alcina had been supreme; and that must be put down in part to his rough treatment of the libretto.
As in Berenice and for the same reason, instead of haunting our memory, the characters come only fitfully to life because they are allowed so little opportunity to explain their actions.
Many of their arias, especially the more virtuoso pieces, have a tenuous connection with the plot.
Only at the end of Act II and the start of Act III does Handel approach the height of his powers.
The Great Storm of June 12th, 1987: my father’s ‚prevision‘ was only out by four months.

Most readers have supposed that when I spoke of theories as incommensurable, I meant that they could not be compared.
But 'incommensurability' is a term borrowed from mathematics, and it there has no such implication.
The hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle is incommensurable with its side, but the two can be compared to any required degree of precision.

Cleveland lay in white and mighty solitude, mute and deaf to the outside world, a city of lonesome snowiness, storm-swept from end to end, when the violence of the two-day blizzard lessened late yesterday afternoon.
We had a Theatrical Entertainment here about a fortnight ago which was performed in Celebration of an Anniversary Festival.
The piece was COMUS; but Dalton and Arne were judged not altogether equal to Handel and Milton in which opinion I am pretty sure your Lordship will concur.
As Handel came to this place for Quiet and Retirement we were very loath to lay any task of Composition upon him.
Selfishness however prevailed; but we determined at the same time to be very moderate in our requests.
His readiness to oblidge soon took off all our apprehensions upon that account.
A hint of what we wanted was sufficient We laid our plan accordingly and reserved his Musick for an at the close of this entertainment.
We likewise intermix’d the Poem with several of his former Compositions which I think gave it great life and beauty.
The whole scheme was concerted and executed in five Days Mr. Handel left us about ten days ago.
He is gone to Scarborough and will visit us again in his return back, which he believ’d would not be long.
I definitely wanted to put more realism in it, more depth.
God Hates Us All isn't an anti-Christian line as much as it's an idea I think a lot of people can relate to on a daily basis.

It’s no 10/10 – to award such a mark for a debut album would be to ask the band to call it quits, as they’re unlikely to ever trump it – but it is a definite contender, alongside Los Campesinos!’s Hold On Now, Youngster, Foals' 'Antidotes' and Wild Beasts’ forthcoming Limbo, Panto, for home-grown debut of the year.
I'm closing down Abyss Studios because of me.
I am not a fucking trademark, I am not a selling point.

I've just been very fortunate to have all these bands coming into my studio, and fortunate enough to have these bands sell a lot of records, but now I'm doing Hypocrisy and Pain 100%.

I figured, as long as I’m going to do a book on compilers, I should include a few other chapters on basic techniques that people would use before they got all the way to compilers.

The latter artist, who has lately returned from Europe and the influence of Gérôme, has also a picture entitled ‚The Champion Single Sculls‘ (No. 137), which, though peculiar, has more than ordinary interest.
The Artist, in dealing so boldly and broadly with the commonplace in nature, is working upon well-supported theories, and despite a somewhat scattered effect, gives promise of a conspicuous future.
The gameplay is downright lame.
While Tonic Trouble claims to sport a fully 3D world, most of it takes place indoors, in caves, or in dungeons, and therefore, camera angles become a serious problem.
The camera is locked to a specific view way too often, and too many of the jumps have to be made blindly.
Tonic Trouble's idea of a challenge is a string of difficult jumps, and the only time you'll really die is when you miss one.

The game boasts excellent multi-parallax scrolling graphics with amazing illusion of depth.
One of the game’s strengths is that the number and pattern of enemies change from game to game, which give the game an excellent replay value since no two game will be exactly the same.
The excellent production value, smooth animations, and even an outstanding soundtrack makes this underdog far above your average shooter.
Viewing the question in its entirety involves not only the vital questions to which Your Imperial Majesty refers, but other basic considerations arising from Hitler's ambition of world conquest.
It is certain that movements of conquest by Germany will continue and will extend beyond Europe to Asia, Africa, and even to the Americas, unless they are stopped by military force.
It is equally certain that those countries which desire to maintain their independence must engage in a great common effort if they are not to be engulfed one by one as has already happened to a large number of countries in Europe.
In recognition of these truths, the Government and people of the United States of America, as is well known, are not only building up the defenses of this country with all possible speed, but they have also entered upon a very extensive program of material assistance to those countries which are actively engaged in resisting German ambition for world domination.
The experience of being transported to an elaborately simulated place is pleasurable in itself, regardless of the fantasy content.
Immersion is a metaphorical term derived from the physical experience of being submerged in water.
We seek the same feeling from a psychologically immersive experience that we do from a plunge in the ocean or swimming pool: the sensation of being surrounded by a completely other reality, as different as water is from air, that takes over all of our attention, our whole perceptual apparatus.

First, and most obviously, it is the character of Ali G − and not the actor playing him − that makes the outrageous remarks and therefore insulates Baron Cohen from public hostility.
In this way, the actor can raise his hands and (appear) to dissociate himself from Ali G’s more objectionable opinions, lifestyle and behaviour.

Chopin understood Beethoven to a degree that no one who has written on the C minor Sonata or the Fantaisie-Impromptu has ever understood him. … The Fantaisie-Impromptu is perhaps the only instance where one genius discloses to us — if only by means of a composition of his own — what he actually hears in the work of another genius.

The Olympic Movement is mourning the loss of a great friend and a hero of humanity.

I had to cool it down.
The „un-huhs“ were more like a groaning and moaning and I had to clean that up considerably.
It was 1975 and I just thought it was a little too risqué.
I contributed; Ulam did not.
I'm sorry I had to answer it in this abrupt way.
Ulam was rightly dissatisfied with an old approach.
He came to me with a part of an idea which I already had worked out and difficulty getting people to listen to.
He was willing to sign a paper.
When it then came to defending that paper and really putting work into it, he refused.
He said, ‘I don't believe in it.’
There’s two elements in the music – an American funk line and a Russian line.
It’s the most obvious demonstration of two tribes that we have today.
The tales are told in neither comic nor tragic fashion but in that matter-of-fact, accepting way that has often been ascribed to the Russian peasant.

Throughout his career, Senator Salazar has campaigned on a pledge of support for 'our land, our water, our people.'
With a perfect 100% score on the 2008 LCV Scorecard, he has lived up to that pledge.
As a westerner, Senator Salazar has hands on experience with land and water issues, and will restore the Department of the Interior's role as the steward of America's public resources.
We look forward to working with him to protect the health of America's land, water, and people in the coming years.
Sometimes they totally forget who they are. And they come out with a totally different side of themselves.
Some try to appear cool with Ali G and down with the kids… Boutros Boutros-Ghali kept on telling me he used to be a bit of a bully in school, and used to muck around. They want Ali G's approval.

a voice of uncommon power, sweetness, extent, and agility On his arrival here, at the first private rehearsal at Cuzzoni's apartments, Lord Cooper, then the principal manager of the opera under Porpora, observing that the band did not follow him, but were all gaping with wonder, as if thunder-struck, desired them to be attentive; when they all confessed, that they were unable to keep pace with him, having not only been disabled by astonishment, but overpowered by his talents.
There was none of all Farinelli's excellencies by which he so far surpassed all other singers, and astonished the public, as his messa di voce, or swell; which, by the natural formation of his lungs, and artificial economy of breath, he was able to protract to such a length as to excite incredulity even in those who heard him; who, though unable to detect the artifice, imagined him to have had the latent help of some instrument by which the tone was continued, while he renewed his powers by respiration.

Sceaf; who, as some affirm, was driven on a certain island in Germany, called Scandza, (of which Jornandes, the historian of the Goths, speaks), a little boy in a skiff, without any attendant, asleep, with a handful of corn at his head, whence he was called Sceaf; and, on account of his singular appearance, being well received by the men of that country, and carefully educated, in his riper age he reigned in a town which was called Slaswic, but at present Haithebi; which country, called old Anglia, whence the Angles came into Britain, is situated between the Saxons and the Goths.

What else is it that should trace the insuperable line?
Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse?
But a full-grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month old.
But suppose they were otherwise, what would it avail?
The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?
Since I Saw You Last is a curiously complex, occasionally courageous record is almost impossible to absorb in one listen.
Two tracks in particular; God and Dying Inside are easily the finest pieces he's ever written. the searching, enigmatic feel worked out over sublime piano playing and sung with a passion rarely heard in any of his previous work.
Such as are not acquainted with the personal character of Handel, will wonder at his seeming temerity, in continuing so long an opposition which tended but to impoverish him; but he was a man of a firm and intrepid spirit, no way a slave to the passion of avarice, and would have gone greater lengths than he did, rather than submit to those whom he had ever looked on as his inferiors: but though his ill success for a series of years had not affected his spirit, there is reason to believe that his genius was in some degree damped by it; for whereas of his earlier operas, that is to say, those composed by him between the years 1710 and 1728, the merits are so great, that few are able to say which is to be preferred; those composed after that period have so little to recommend them, that few would take them for the work of the same author.
In the former class are Radamistus, Otho, Tamerlane, Rodelinda, Alexander, and Admetus, in either of which scarcely an indifferent air occurs; whereas in Parthenope, Porus, Sosarmes, Orlando, Ætius, Ariadne, and the rest down to 1736, it is a matter of some difficulty to find a good one.
I have received the finale by degrees.
I read the script without the secret scenes, then I read the secret scenes, then I shot the script and each time I’m thinking about 'what does this mean?'
When I first read it, the ending wasn’t clear to me – but since then it’s grown more clear and I have to say, grown more satisfying the more I think about it.
I expect a mixture of satisfaction and consternation amongst the viewers when it airs.
But once they rewatch it, rethink about it and possibly look at the saga again, gradually they will feel like they have just read a good novel — but you have to chew on it for a while.

Until 1930 I sympathized with the social democratic party, voted for it and was a member of a socialdemocratic union (Bund Techn. Agst. u.

(I really became unemployed in 1932.)
The great amount of unemployment caused expansion of nationalsoc. and communistic parties.
Frightened that the latter one would become the government I Joined the NSDAP (a legally reg. entity) to help, I believed in the preservation of the western culture.
The more I thought about this, the more I realized that such a resource, containing general, encyclopedic knowledge for the layman, would be an important tool for some types of research, and for the Net.Citizenry in general. but what about contributors… where will you find authors to write the short articles you need?
Well, I'd first have to start out by finding some way of communicating with an extremely diverse set of people… everyone from linguists, to molecular biologists, from animal rights activists to zymurgists, and from geographers to gas chromotographers.

So I thought about it some more… … and came to the conclusion that this is a good idea!

The music actually tells a story in itself, even without my vocals on it, so I let myself be driven by it.
To be able to put a melody on a track that already had a life, that just blew me away.
It's great, passionate music.
Timbaland turned on all his creative juices - I think this is definitely some of his best work. (...)
Every song, every lyric, is acted out through the tone of my voice.
It's not just about sounding good, it's about singing so people can really relate and hear exactly what you're saying and feel exactly where you're coming from. (...)
To confront the things I've gone through can be very difficult (...)
But I've been able to do that on this album, to let everything go and just push it behind that mic.
My experiences were reflected on my other records, but it was like they were coded.
On this new album, you hear it.
You hear the struggle.
You hear the frustration.
You hear the happiness.
You hear my yearning to be in love.
Whereas before, people would say, 'Oh, she can sing,' or 'This is a good record,' but you couldn't really hear me.
You didn't hear the passion. You hear it now, because I'm connected to it.
Aquesta part compresa entre el Camell I l'Àguila que tu coneixes i estimes tant com jo mateix és i ha de continuar per sempre sent geologia pura, sense res que pugui mitificar-lo, ho faig una qüestió de principis.
És un paratge mitològic que es fet per Déus més que per a Homes i cal que continuï tal com està.
Stated most succinctly, runs: The world exhibits teleological order (design, adaptation).
Therefore, it was produced by an intelligent designer.
I don’t have a teacher as a crewmember.
I have a crewmember who used to be a teacher.
In fact it (album name) was ripped off from a cover of Vogue about two and a half years ago.
They had a whole series of covers which featured just one word like ‘Success’ , ‘Red’, and ‘Dare’.
Since the experience of Spain, which may possible live in history as actually the test war to end war, we know that the ‚blitzkrieg‘ theory of Gen. Goering – that a swift and fearful air attack can be made which will totally demoralize populations – is no longer tenable.
On Tuesday last Signor Dominico Annibali, the celebrated Italian Singer lately arriv'd from Dresden, to perform in Mr. Handel's Opera in Coven-Garden, was sent for to Kensington, and had the Honour to sing several Songs before her Majesty and the Princesses, who express’d the highest Satisfaction at his Performance.
Ringo always got and still gets a unique sound out of his drums, a sound as distinctive as his voice. Ringo gets a looser deeper sound out of his drums that is unique.
This detailed attention to the tone of his drums is one of the reasons for Ringo’s brilliance.
Another is that although Ringo does not keep time with a metronome accuracy, he has unrivaled feel for a song.
If his timing fluctuates, it invariably does so in the right place at the right time, keep the right atmosphere going on the track and give it a rock solid foundation.
This held true for every single Beatles number Richie played. Ringo also as a great tom tom player.
The best sports movie of the decade – and one of the best since Martin Scorsese backlit Robert De Niro’s Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull 30 years ago.
The Opera will not survive after this winter I am certain excepting some few, the English have no real taste for musick; for if they had, they could not neglect an entertainment so perfect in its kind for a parcel of ballad singers.
I am so peevish about it, that I have no patience.
Born on a mountain, raised in a cave, bikin’ and fuckin’ is all we crave.
All the music in the score is subdivisions and multiplications of the tempo of the Édith Piaf track.
So I could slip into half-time; I could slip into a third of a time.
Anything could go anywhere. At any moment I could drop into a different level of time.
Color-blind racism allows Whites to appear ‘not racist (“I believe in equality”), preserve their privileged status (“Discrimination ended in the sixties!”), blame Blacks for their lower status (“If you guys just work hard!”), and criticize any institutional approach – such as affirmative action – that attempts to ameliorate racial inequality (“Reverse discrimination!”)
There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.
Christianity will go.
It will vanish and shrink.
We’re more popular than Jesus now – I don’t know which will go first, rock and roll or Christianity.
His theory of impact is faulty, but his explanation of the expansive force of gases is essentially the same as in the dynamical theory, as it now stands.
The Box in which their Royal Highnesses sat, was of white Satin, beautifully Ornamented with Festons of Flowers in their proper Colours, and in Front was a flaming Heart, between two Hymeneal Torches, whose different Flames terminated in one Point, and were surmounted with a Label, on which were wrote, in Letters of Gold, these Words, MUTUUS ARDOR.
"NME bands" fall within very narrow parameters.
In the 80s, the paper prided itself on its coverage of hip hop, R&B and the emerging dance scene which it took seriously and featured prominently - alongside the usual Peel-endorsed indie fare.
Now, though, its range of approved bands has dramatically shrunk to a strand embodied by the Monkeys, Babyshambles and Muse - bands who you don't need specialist knowledge to write about and who are just "indie" enough to make readers feel they're part of a club.
State sovereignty, national union
This year we explored the failure of democracy, how the social scientists brought our world to the brink of chaos.
We talked about the veterans, how they took control and imposed the stability that has lasted for generations since.
I wanted to say I am sorry for the loss of your son.
I did not know how old he was, I thought he was a little bit younger than I am.
And I did not know if he was armed or not.
Few men probably receive more communications from earth flatteners and circle squarers and arc trisectors than the present writer.
When he receives one he does not feel pleased, and yet it ought to be pleasant to think that there are so many men in the world who refuse to accept a dogma.
A crank is defined as a man who cannot be turned.
These men are all cranks; at all events, we have never succeeded in convincing one of them.
When they use a term, sometimes evidently in two different syllogism, it is impossible to find exactly what they mean by it.
I was this morning regaled with Mr. Handel’s new opera called Arminius, it was rehearsed at Covent Garden; I think it is as fine a one as any he has made
Miles Davis' first comeback record finds the trumpeter a bit shaky and has a few poppish throwaway tracks; it is doubtful if anyone really remembers the title cut or Shout.
Signora Merighi, Signora Chimenti, and The Francesina (Three Singer lately come from Italy, for the Royal Academy of Musick) had the Honour to sing before her Majesty, the Duke, and Princesses, at Kensington, on Monday Night last, and met with a most gracious Reception, and her Majesty was pleased to approve their several Performances: after which, The Francesina, performed several Dances to the entire Satisfaction of the Court.
A friend of mine told me about the drummer who was 11 at the time and said how amazing he was.
I ended up hearing a demo that wasn't very good but because I was right down the street from where they were playing I went up and saw them and was actually very impressed.
I made a development deal and have now been working with them for over a year and a half.
I'm with them six hours, six days a week.
I have them in a rehearsal room right next to Warner Brothers

He had his hair Mod-style.
We said, ‘Would you do our hair like yours?’
When they socialize the doctors, then they will socialize the lawyers.
Then next they will socialize insurance men, and when they socialize the insurance men, the farmer will be next.
They plan to socialize everybody.
Law may prescribe that the male nipples be made equal to the female ones, but they still will not give milk.
… the machinery of my work is of a species by itself; two contrary motions are introduced into it, and reconcile, which were thought to be at variance with each other.
In a word, my work is digressive and it is progressive, too,– and at the same time.
A language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software.
Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
One of my favourite things I ever did conceptually was to kill them off comepletely in America by getting them to cover ‚Born to Run‘.
I saw them play in San Francisco and they started ‚Born to Run‘, and people were horrified.
The television adaptation is surprisingly scary and remarkably good, a show that visually echoes the stylized comic-book aesthetic of the original and combines elegant suspense with gratifyingly crude and gruesome slasher-film gore.
I did not reveal any US operations against legitimate military targets.
I pointed out where the NSA has hacked civilian infrastructure such as universities, hospitals, and private businesses because it is dangerous… the public needs to know the kinds of things a government does in its name, or the ‘consent of the governed’ is meaningless.
It attempts to be highly customizable while relying entirely on the keyboard for input.

Only a certain part of the Iraqi body is bad.
The rest is good — just like the scorpion.
When i look back at Bastards and Conquerors, I feel that it never got the promotion it deserved.
Also I'm not happy with the sound, it sounds too "demo-ish".
However we will be back better than ever with our 3rd album.
In my own opinion, this material beats everything I've ever written before
It was probably the one and only time in my whole career that I felt like applauding the opposition scoring a goal.
It is a record about the death and decay of the human body, sex, lost love, mental breakdown, football and, ultimately, that there probably isn’t a light at the end of the tunnel.
Last Night the famous Signora Strada arriv’d from Holland, who is come on purpose to sing next Thursday in a Concert of Musick at the Swan Tavern in Exchange-Alley.
I was like: 'Oh my God, Rodney, this is it'... this is exactly what the industry needs.
We can maybe change the game with this!'...
Yes, hurry it up, you Hoosier bastard!
I could kill ten men while you're fooling around!
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.
All I ask for, at the end, is a long resting place by the side of Innominate Tarn, on Haystacks.
This album sounds very much like the early Roxy one, not in terms of sound but in terms of juxtaposition of things that are definitely going somewhere very interesting with things that are the remains of something else.
Y r Lord p’s information concerning M r Handel’s Disorder was y e first I received – I can assure Y r Lord p it gave me no Small Concern – when y e Fate of Harmony depends upon a Single Life, the Lovers of Harmony may be well allowed to be Sollicitous.
I heartily regrett y e thought of losing any of y e executive part of his meritt, but this I can gladly compound for, when we are assured of the Inventive, for tis this which properly constitutes y e Artist, & Separates Him from y e Multitude.
It is certainly an Evidence of great Strength of Constitution to be so Soon getting rid of So great a Shock.
A weaker Body would perhaps have hardly born y e Violence of Medicines, w ch operate So quickly.
Mr. Dupieux obviously has sufficient creative control (seen especially in the video simulating the perspective of waste passing through a dog’s digestive tract).
But that’s not the same as giving a movie shape and drive, and it would take a firmer hand to right this “Wrong.”
until 'Hellhammer' and 'Dead' joined the band in 1989 , MAYHEM was a shitty, "fun", Hobby-band.
If you read the lyrics on their 'Deathcrush' album you'll know what I mean.
I always try to have a soundtrack in my mind .
Like when we did Trainspotting, it was Underworld.
For me, the soundtrack to 28 Days Later was Godspeed.
The whole film was cut to Godspeed in my head.
This opera, though it contains but few airs in a great and elaborate style, was so dramatic and pleasing, that it ran fifteen nights successively in the spring season, and was again brought on the stage in the autumn, when it sustained four representations more.
I used to like specific lines from songs – ‘I’d rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man’– so I wrote it around that
No More Games.
No More Bombs.
No More Walking.
No More Fun.
No More Swimming. 67.
That is 17 years past 50. 17 more than I needed or wanted.
Boring.
I am always bitchy.
No Fun--—for anybody.
You are getting greedy. Act your old age.
Relax—--This won’t hurt.
Interviewer: You once wrote that you’re “not religious as that term is conventionally understood.”"Rodney Stark: That’s true, though I’ve never been an atheist.
Atheism is an active faith; it says, “I believe there is no God.” But I don’t know what I believe.
I was brought up a Lutheran in Jamestown, North Dakota.
I have trouble with faith.
I’m not proud of this.
I don’t think it makes me an intellectual.
I would believe if I could, and I may be able to before it’s over.
I would welcome that."
I’ll say it again in the land of the free.
Use your freedom of choice
At night, Radamistus, a fine opera of Handel’s making.
The King there with his ladies.
The Prince in the stage-box.
Great crowd.
This action will be seen as intervention by a western country in the internal affairs of a small independent nation, however unattractive its regime.
I ask you to consider this in the context of our wider East-West relations and of the fact that we will be having in the next few days to present to our Parliament and people the siting of cruise missiles in this country.
I cannot conceal that I am deeply disturbed by your latest communication.
It wasn't anything to do with the way Kiss and Alice Cooper used make-up Dead actually wanted to look like a corpse.
He didn't do it to look cool.
He would draw snot dripping out of his nose.
That doesn't look cool.
He called it corpse-paint.
If a girl goes to bed with nine guys, who's going to believe her when she says the tenth one's the father?
The Hasmoneans built their extension to the southern end of the original Temple Mount in 152 BC, before the Akra was razed by Simon in about 137 BC.
In conclusion, our study does not indicate any harmful effect of nicotine when given in its pure form by inhalation.
When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.
This is the place: these narrow ways diverging to the right and left, and reeking every where with dirt and filth.
Such lives as are led here, bear the same fruit here as elsewhere.
The coarse and bloated faces at the doors have counterparts at home and all the wide world over.
Debauchery has made the very houses prematurely old.
See how the rotten beams are tumbling down, and how the patched and broken windows seem to scowl dimly, like eyes that have been hurt in drunken frays.
Many of these pigs live here.
Do they ever wonder why their masters walk upright in lieu of going on all-fours? and why they talk instead of grunting?
They all got together up there and there was a bloody massacre because I think they shot about three hundred natives all in one hit and there was a hell of a row over it.
It was all published in the papers and somebody let the cat out of the bag and anyhow the government and the judges in those times they realised what the trouble was and the whole thing was hushed up you see.
Of all Handel’s operas, Ariodante is perhaps the most accessible to an untutored modern audience It falls into none of the usual categories Ariodante makes a powerful impact in the theatre, thanks not only to the interest of the plot and the vitality of the characters, but to the skill with which Handel binds the constituent elements, including orchestration and stage action, into a musico-dramatic unity As in Orlando, he relaxes many of the more restrictive bonds of opera seria.
If you look at the lyrics you can see that underneath the jokiness they are saying ‚Isn’t old age awful?
Banality, tedium, nothingness, poverty, routine‘.
When we finished Reign in Blood, we had this meeting with Rubin, and he was like, “Do you realize how short this is?” And we’re going, “Oh, fuck… ” And then we all collectively looked at each other and said, “So what?”
We’re interested in information, we’re not interested in music as such.
And we believe that the whole battlefield, if there is one in the human situation, is about information.
We took Good bye with our companions. & set sail on our 870 miles to South Georgia for assistance...we were in the open sea wet through but happy through it all.
Born and nurtured within the Tijuana-San Diego borderlands, Tijuana NO! concocts antigovernment, anti-U.S., anti-imperialist, anti-PRI, anti-racist, anti-NAFTA, pro-immigrant, pro-Zapatista, pro-anarchy punk explosives
It may have been jazz-rock after Bitches Brew, but after Head Hunters jazz-funk was the flavour de jour.
Inspired by Sly and the Family Stone’s Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) there’s even a tribute track on it called Sly.
The release represented a u-turn of spectacular proportions from the more esoteric direction mapped out on Crossings and Sextant to an album aimed squarely at the dance floor which is where it scored.
Chameleon, the single taken from the album (also a biggie for Maynard Ferguson), sped up the Billboard chart to number 13 and made this one of the biggest selling jazz albums of all time
It appears that Iran's head of Judiciary has no ability to control even his own judges, ...
This is an outrageous violation of Iranian as well as international human rights law, and a callous affront to basic human dignity.
I think the Austrian business-cycle theory has done the world a great deal of harm.
If you go back to the 1930s, which is a key point, here you had the Austrians sitting in London, Hayek and Lionel Robbins, and saying you just have to let the bottom drop out of the world.
You’ve just got to let it cure itself.
You can’t do anything about it.
You will only make it worse. … I think by encouraging that kind of do-nothing policy both in Britain and in the United States, they did harm.
Wise Guys" is an abundant movie, filled with ideas and gags and great characters.
It never runs dry.
This movie was made with joy, and you can feel it in the sense of all the actors working at the top of their form.
We don’t fit into stereotypes at all.
I mean if you get into our van for our tour, we got 8 bottles of nail polish, like 10 fashion magazines, we are all very vain and like to dress up, we wear lingerie and all that shit, totally without apologizing for it all.
Some feminists think you have to be on one side of the fence or the other.
I kinda laugh at that cause there are so many different ways of being a strong feminist woman.
I claim to be a feminist, definitely, I’ll totally give props to that movement.
For some idiotic reason, in the mid-'80s the New York scene split in two, and you were either a hardcore kid in jock clothes or a punk with a million band names written on your studded jacket; however, we always thought of it as being one type of music: hardcore/punk.
The game's appeal hasn't dropped off at all in the past 15 years, and elements like the leveling-up system and ring menus continue to feel unique even after a decade and a half. there are many more reasons it's been named to the Top 100 Games of All Time, so many times, over the years. Secret of Mana is well worth your notice you can rediscover (or experience for the first time) one of Squaresoft's most loved 16-bit SNES classics.
It is now 30 seconds to zero time.
Put on goggles or turn away.
Do not remove goggles or face blast until 10 seconds after the first light.
Do what we may to inject life into our ailing economic order, we cannot make it endure for long unless we bring about a wiser, more equitable distribution of national income … the reward for a day's work will have to be greater, on average, than it has been, and the reward for capital, especially capital that is speculative, will have to be less.
Speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.

Last Night the famous Signora Strada arriv’d from Holland, who is come on purpose to sing next Thursday in a Concert of Musick at the Swan Tavern in Exchange-Alley.
The Germans formed up on one side, the English on the other, the officers standing in front, every head bared.
Yes, I think it was a sight one will never see again.
It was a remarkable discovery that an attenuated thread of carbon would possess all the long-sought qualities of a practical burner when maintained in a perfect vacuum.
The extreme fragility of such a structure was calculated to discourage experimentation with it, and it does not detract in the least from the originality of the conception that previous patents hat suggested that thin plates or pencils or small bridges could be used.
The futility of hoping to maintain a burner in vacuum with any permanency had discouraged prior inventors, and Mr. Edison is entitled to the credit of obviating the mechanical difficulties which disheartened them, … .
There are three sculptures on the rocks behind the village of Sarpul on the Baghdad-Hamadan road.
The most elaborate one represents a triumph of Annubanini, king of the Lullu, a tribe related to the Kashshu.
From the Akkadian inscription we may infer the time of Naram Sin of Akkad as the date of the sculpture.
I think you will feel that the dramatis personæ of the swimming pool are real men and boys.
Despite their nudity we recognize them as belonging to the early seventies.
There is something about the way they wear their hair which gives the date.
The man half lying on the dock is unmistakably an American.
It is an invaluable statement of historical fact.
So men looked and so men acted in these our United States during the lifetime of Thomas Eakins.
What? This is ridiculous.
I just want to make a dungeon.
I don't want to schedule it on my alarm clock for six days to come back for a block to be chipped.
Polanski directs it without compromise or apology, and it’s a funny thing how critics may condescend to it, but while they’re watching it you could hear a pin drop.
Whatever you say, it’s silly to argue about whether it happened this way or that way when the situation is clear.
There were hundreds and thousands of , including me, during those fifty years of war between Japan and China.
At any rate, it was nothing more than a commonplace occurrence during the so-called Chinese Disturbance.
The key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.
So help me Codd!
We have always believed that it’s important to differentiate between different types of government requests.
We already publish criminal requests separately from national security letters.
Lumping the two categories together would be a step back for users.
Our request to the government is clear: to be able to publish aggregate numbers of national security requests, including FISA disclosures, separately.
Each member state shall conduct a statewide popular election for President and Vice President of the United States.
In 1972 I was in the south of France.
I had eaten some bad fish and was in consequence rather ill.
As I lay in bed I had a strange recurring vision, there, before me, was a concrete building like a hotel or council block.
I could see into the rooms, each of which was continually scanned by an electronic eye.
In the rooms were people, everyone of them preoccupied.
In one room a person was looking into a mirror and in another a couple were making love but lovelessly, in a third a composer was listening to music through earphones.
Around him there were banks of electronic equipment.
But all was silence. Like everyone in his place he had been neutralized, made grey and anonymous.
The scene was for me one of ordered desolation.
It was as if I were looking into a place which had no heart.
Next day when I felt better, I was on the beach sunbathing and suddenly a poem popped into my head.
It started out 'I am the proprietor of the Penguin Cafe, I will tell you things at random' and it went on about how the quality of randomness, spontaneity, surprise, unexpectedness and irrationality in our lives is a very precious thing.
And if you suppress that to have a nice orderly life, you kill off what's most important.
Whereas in the Penguin Cafe your unconscious can just be.
It's acceptable there, and that's how everybody is.
There is an acceptance there that has to do with living the present with no fear in ourselves.
Some of the scenes in this movie are shameless (Roberts trying to talk his son out of a coma).
Some are hilarious (Kirkland explaining how to focus your concentration, while we hear flute music designed as a subtle ripoff of Mr. Miyagi in Karate Kid).
Some are gratuitous (the Texan directs racist insults at the Asian, then of course has an offscreen change of heart).
Some are inexplicable (why do we keep seeing that slow-motion black-and-white shot of the ice cream cone being dropped?).
There is not a single scene in this movie that I found amusing, original or interesting.
What we really have here is a documentary of the actors wasting their lives.
Rothschild of this place has executed the various services entrusted to him in this line admirably well, and though a Jew, we place a good deal of confidence in him.
… nowadays HN and other forms of type encoding are simply impediments.
They make it harder to change the name or type of a variable, function, member or class.
They make it harder to read the code.
And they create the possibility that the encoding system will mislead the reader.
And a state may penalize utterances , by their very nature, involve danger to the public peace and to the security of the state.
You furnish the pictures.
I’ll furnish the war.
The first album is a live album, it really is, and it's done intentionally in that way.
It's got overdubs on it, but the original tracks are live.
Something was written on the piano while we were making the White album.
I had a break while Paul was doing some overdubbing so I went in an empty studio and began to write.
That’s really all there is to it, except the middle took some time to sort it out!
One thing I find myself wondering about is whether we shouldn’t try and make the “ACPI” extensions somehow Windows specific.
It seems unfortunate if we do this work and get our partners to do the work and the result is that Linux works great without having to do the work.
Maybe there is no way to avoid this problem but it does bother me.
Maybe we could define the APIs so that they work well with NT and not the others even if they are open.
Or maybe we could patent something related to this.
… as a guitarist/composer, Barrios is the best of the lot, regardless of era.
His music is better formed, it's more poetic, it's more everything!
And it's more of those things in a timeless way. So I think he's a more significant composer than Sor or Giuliani, and a more significant composer – for the guitar – than Villa-Lobos.
In irresponsible hands it could, as it often had under Martin Dies, become a threat to civil liberties, by using the authority and prestige of Congress for unscrupulous or bigoted ends.
No. Because without wanting to get too specific, this particular cancer is caused by HPV , which actually comes about from cunnilingus.
There’s no money in it, Walter.
I’m married now, and I have to think of my family.
‘Avatar’ is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that.
It’s a technical breakthrough.
It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message.
It is predestined to launch a cult.
It contains such visual detailing that it would reward repeating viewings.
It invents a new language, Na’vi, as ‘Lord of the Rings’ did, although mercifully I doubt this one can be spoken by humans, even teenage humans.
It creates new movie stars.
It is an Event, one of those films you feel you must see to keep up with the conversation.
prays aloud after dinner, invoking the aid of God in destroying our enemies.
This is highly approved of by the Maltese, who have the same idea about God, but I would prefer an efficient Air force here.
I thought how courageous it was for a producer to tell HBO that he wanted to hire this young woman, who they never heard of, to shoot this really tough show in Baltimore.
It must have been a fight for him, to get me approved.
Rather than being another side-scrolling game, Shadow Sorcerer could almost be classified as a very early real-time strategy game.
Gamers who had wished for SSI to abandon its mediocre attempts at a side-scroller were about to get what they wanted, and they weren't going to like it.
This album is phenomenal, yet sometimes unbearable.
The album starts with the words ‚Auschwitz, the meaning of pain‘.
For sheer numbness of purpose, nothing beats ‚Angel of Death,‘ Slayer's commentary on Nazi Joseph Mengele.
Mengele was a ‚sadist of the noblest blood‘ who ‚toiled to benefit the Aryan race‘ by performing ‚surgery with no anesthesia.‘ Jeez, if you ever wondered what effect Hogan's Heroes had on our culture, this is it – a view of the Holocaust as comic-book drama, as removed from reality as the Black Plague or Darth Vader.
The tune is clearly meant to reinstate the spiritual calm of 'Goin’ Back Home', but its message — that extraterrestrial escape on a 'silent ship' is the only way to deal with the grim world Fogerty envisions on the rest of the LP — is flatly dispiriting, a cartoon updating of gospel music’s yearning for redemption.
The single most powerful image of nuclear devastation in American popular cinema.
No, the 'Lublin Regime' is no victory for socialism.
It is the reduction of Poland to a vassal state … Woe to those who want to maintain their independent views and policies.
I know the whole world is watching now.
I wish you could see what I can see.
Sometimes you have to be up really high to understand how small you are … I’m going home now.
A dead man can't leak stuff.
This guy's a traitor, he's treasonous, and he has broken every law of the United States.
And I'm not for the death penalty, so there's only one way to do it: illegally shoot the son of a bitch.
I’m at ease with myself, maybe.
I’m happy to be making records, by getting away from the music business I was in a good mood to do it you know, it’s just the fun of doing it and trying to sustain the energy and the interest.
A valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other.
We’re writing them as movies and then we’re going to chop them up, reconfigure them, write new material and try to make them work as separate episodes.
(ii) that the red line drawn on the attached chart, entitled 'Boundary-Line Chart' — which forms an integral part of the present Decision (Compromiso of 22 July 1971, Article XII (1)) —constitutes the boundary between the territorial and maritime jurisdictions of the Republics of Argentina and Chile respectively, within the limits of the area bounded by the straight lines joining the co-ordinate points ABCDEF specified in Article I (4) of the said Compromiso, and known as the 'Hammer' (Decision, paragraph 1);
Even if everything in DTU were picture-perfect, this would still be a derivative game, treading the same path of all the AD&D computer games that inundated the market from the late 1980s into the early 1990s.
But if it looked good and played smoothly there'd at least be some happy AD&D fans right now; as it stands, no one's happy, and in fact, a lot of people are downright angry.
The lesson to be learned should be obvious: If you're gonna ride the hype machine, you'd better deliver the goods.
Today is the Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti Memorial Day.
The atmosphere of their trial and appeals were permeated by prejudice against foreigners and hostility toward unorthodox political views.
The conduct of many of the officials involved in the case shed serious doubt on their willingness and ability to conduct the prosecution and trial fairly and impartially.
Simple decency and compassion, as well as respect for truth and an enduring commitment to our nation's highest ideals, require that the fate of Sacco and Vanzetti be pondered by all who cherish tolerance, justice and human understanding.
So, let me own up to that agenda.
It’s to be protected against violent crimes driven by bigotry.
It’s to be able to get married.
It’s to be able to get a job and it’s to be able to fight for our country.
Hey, for those, for those who are worried about the radical homosexual agenda, let me put them on notice – two down, two to go.
"I don’t look for happiness.
So perhaps I am very content in life, in a way.
I suppose being at peace with yourself. Not anxiously seeking for something, not being frantic about not having something.
But I argue with myself all the time, so I guess I’m not really at peace.
Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise.
But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation.
When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.
The right to ask questions, debate, and dissent is under attack.
The drums of war are beaten ever louder in an attempt to drown out those who speak of our predicament in stark terms.
Even in the Senate, our history and tradition of being the world's greatest deliberative body is being snubbed.
This huge spending bill – $ 87 billion – has been rushed through this chamber in just one month.
There were just three open hearings by the Senate Appropriations Committee on $ 87 billion – $ 87 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born – $ 87 billion without a single outside witness called to challenge the administration’s line.
I'd love to do a rally game actually.
The problem is getting someone to pay for it.
We, like most developers, work hand to mouth at the mercy of publishers when it comes to the money side.
We've pitched rally concepts before to publishers and even offered to go half on the funding but still no interest.
the worst of all Handel's Compositions, yet half the songs are good.
I know the 101’ers were good.
In fact, as far as sound and excitement went we were much better than Eddie and the Hot Rods.
The other guys in the group were twenty-five and twenty-six and they played good because they’d spent a few years getting that far.
But they were just too old.
What I really wanted was to get in with some young yobbo’s who I was more in tune with.
For the first time in the history of the world, a young girl climbed into a tree one day a Princess and after having what she described as her most thrilling experience she climbed down from the tree next day a Queen — God bless her.
The predominating opinion in post-war Germany was that Hitler had ignored Owens.
We therefore decided not to report on the photo.
The consensus was that Hitler had to continue to be painted in a bad light in relation to Owens.
As much as any one can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoils, so much he may by his labour fix a Property in: Whatever is beyond this, is more than his share, and belongs to others.
Nothing was made by God for Man to spoil or destroy.
Old Celtic Frost, Voivod, Possessed, Kreator, and Slayer were the bands we were listening to before we decided to form Holy Hell.
Of course, the creators of heavy metal themselves, Black Sabbath, were a crucial influence, especially the first four albums.
We wanted to do everything more extreme and original compared to the bands that I just mentioned.
The front was limited, heavily fortified, and held in strength.
There was no flank to turn.
A break-through must be made by whoever was the stronger and wished to take the offensive.
In this way we are led back to the battles of the First World War on the Western Front.
We see here repeated in Egypt the same kind of trial of strength as was presented at Cambrai at the end of 1917, and in many battles of 1918,
Dogs like that, which share man’s hard times and strenuous work, cannot be looked upon merely as animals.
They are supporters and friends.
There is no such thing as making a pet out of a sledge dog; these animals are worth much more than that.
Back in ’78 Systems of Romance was probably the most important album to me in terms of how I wanted to approach electronic music.
It was exactly where I wanted to go with my own music.
It occurred to me that if I could invent a machine – a gun – which could by its rapidity of fire, enable one man to do as much battle duty as a hundred, that it would, to a large extent supersede the necessity of large armies, and consequently, exposure to battle and disease be greatly diminished.
Somebody once said that people are either doers or describers.
The former prefer WYSIWSG interfaces, which you can make do things as you watch, whereas the latter (a smaller fraction of the population, I think) prefer to create files that describe their requirements, that is, they like markup languages.
Armenians in this region of Georgia should think about learning Georgian instead of how they could replace it with Armenian.
Without the knowledge of Georgian Armenians in Georgia will not be able to seek senior and high government position and can not run successful businesses.

His voice was at first a powerful and clear soprano, which afterwards changed into the fullest, finest, and deepest counter-tenor that has perhaps ever been heard Carestini's person was tall, beautiful, and majestic.
He was a very animated and intelligent actor, and having a considerable portion of enthusiasm in his composition, with a lively and inventive imagination, he rendered every thing he sung interesting by good taste, energy, and judicious embellishments.
He manifested great agility in the execution of difficult divisions from the chest in a most articulate and admirable manner.
It was the opinion of Hasse, as well as of many other eminent professors, that whoever had not heard Carestini was inacquainted with the most perfect style of singing.
It is commonly reported this Gentleman was never cut out for a Singer.
if he would give his nuts for a piece of metal, pleased with its color, or exchange his sheep for shells, or wool for a sparkling pebble or diamond, and keep those by him all his life, he invaded not the right of others, he might heap up as much of the durable things as he pleased; the exceeding of the bounds of his property not lying in the largeness of his possessions, but the perishing of any thing uselessly in it.
Ruby Tuesday is a good candidate for the most melodic Mick Jagger-Keith Richards composition ever, and it was a number one hit in early 1967.
This is one of the few Rolling Stones songs that could be fairly said to be as melodic as any of the best Lennon-McCartney compositions.
It might be supposed that the conjunction of the age’s greatest opera composer with its most successful librettist, a master of language and a fine poet to boot, would have outstandingly fruitful results.
But while all three of their joint operas contain magnificent music, none ranks with Handel’s masterpieces of 1724–25 and 1734–35 (though Poro comes near it).
The divergence of temperament was too wide.
Metastastio, as befits a cleric, wrote with an edifying purpose.
As Caesarian poet at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor for half a century, he was to dictate rules of conduct and lay down standards for public and private life and maintenance of the status quo.
Already in his early librettos moral issues are liable to take precedence over human values.
He moves his characters like pieces on a chessboard, so that they run the risk of declining into abstractions.
In all this his approach was the antithesis of Handel’s.
It is no matter for surprise that after setting three of his librettos Handel abandoned him, just as his reputation was reaching its peak of popularity, for the wilder slopes of Ariosto’s world of magic and romance.
a good soul.
I love that she is so compassionate.
She is wise beyond her years.
She has remarkable optimism, despite the fact that she's disappointed so often.
The history of Algebra began in ancient Egypt, and thus it was Egyptians who taught Algebra to members of their society, those close by who came in droves from Greece, and the rest of the world.
The last time I checked, Egypt was and still remains to be located in North Africa.
Why on earth, would anyone assume that the teaching of Algebra in an Afrocentric school system would be accompanied by street slang, suggestive of a particular aspect of popular culture, which whether its origins are to be found among a select few among African American proponents of Black popular culture, does not mean that expressions such as the one your cartoon utilizes should be used to depict the teaching methods employed by Afrocentric teachers to their learners.
The cartoon is racist, inflammatory, completely and utterly ignorant and highly out of a place, especially in a national newspaper, which has regularly sought to depict its stance among readers as a fair and just one
Blakey was in on the ground floor when it came to the evolution of hard bop into soul jazz, having co-led the first Jazz Messengers with Horace Silver back in 1956.
By 1958 he’d gone through a number of versions of the band, with this becoming the blueprint version for the next half a decade.
With Benny Golson and Bobby Timmons supplying hard bop anthems such as the title tune, ‘Along Came Betty’ and ‘Blues March’, and the front line soloists refining their long, elaborate post-bop lines into the shorter and more pithy soul-based hard bop lines of the late 1950s, this Blakey band, and this Blakey album, defined soul jazz“.
If it is a question of wisdom and judgment, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance.
The power of it was that is was real.
It was there.
You could walk into it and live with those animals.
If there had ever been the question in the audience’s mind as to whether the forest and this creatures were true, the hunter’s hounds could never have chased Faline, Bambi’s mother could never have been shot, and Man could not have been the predator that he was.

We've been digitally transferring all of Kraftwerk's original recordings and sound sources from our badly degrading master tapes while our engineers, Fritz and Henning, have been working in parallel to remaster our early albums for re-release.
So for the first time, our recordings will be available in crisp, clear Kling Klang sound with all the fold-out covers and images our label at the time either messed up or wouldn't pay for.
Our upcoming EP is titled "100% No Modern Talking".
Will contain 4 tracks: 'Internet Friends', 'Tourniquet', 'Fire Hive', and 'Back To The Z-List'.
The current plan is to make it available for free, as well as through Beatport / iTunes / anywhere else we can put it.
It looks like we’re terribly reckless people. But there was absolutely no one in Washington — senators, congressmen, even the president — who dared hold J. Edgar Hoover to accountability.
It became pretty obvious to us, that if we don’t do it, nobody will.
We were crossing Wall Street in New York in a stretch limousine, celebrating the fact that we'd got in the charts with Rubber Bullets, and we'd gone across the big financial district of America there, and just as we were going across the street, Lol said 'Wall Street!
The Wall Street Shuffle!' And I said 'Do the Wall Street Shuffle,' the melody, I had the melody in my head.
But it was Lol, Lol's words.
Wall Street Shuffle.
I’m an average nobody. I get to live the rest of my life as a schnook.
There was an extremely high level of works presented by slammers from several continents.

In Clannad, the protagonist is 17 year-old Tomoya Okazaki, a teen delinquent from a broken family; his mother died in a car accident when he was young, and a fight with his abusing father led to a serious injury, crashing his aspirations for a career in basketball.
Such backgrounds are common for protagonists in many works.
The Hopi Cultural Preservation Office is not aware of Hopi people ever practicing ‘Ear Candeling.’
This therapy should not be called ‘Hopi Ear Candeling.’
The history of Ear Candeling should not refer to being used by the Hopi Tribe.
Use of this false information with reference to Hopi should be stopped.
As soon as the war ended, we located the one spot on earth that hadn’t been touched by the war and blew it to hell.
They haven’t made a great or distinguished film, but working within a tired genre with a talented cast, they’ve brought unusual substance and impact to the DTM.
I know that if you want to, you can do much and do it well.
On the other hand, if you do little and do it badly, it will mean that you are not working willingly; and“—slowly and deliberately—“it is my habit to shoot those who give proof of ill-will.
No I don't recommend 'Hungarian'.
I regard 'Hungarian' (embedding an abbreviated version of a type in a variable name) a technique that can be useful in untyped languages, but is completely unsuitable for a language that supports generic programming and object-oriented programming—both of which emphasize selection of operations based on the type an arguments (known to the language or to the run-time support).
In this case, 'building the type of an object into names' simply complicates and minimizes abstraction.
I don't know why but everybody has a hit in Germany.

If there is any hope for a decent government to emerge from the ashes of the Gadhafi dictatorship, this is it.
Throwing our weight behind the transitional government is our best chance to prevent Libya's unraveling into postwar anarchy—precisely the circumstance under which Islamist extremists are most likely to gain a foothold.
One of the meanings of night is its collocability with dark and of dark, of course, collocation with night.
Many lamented but more rejoiced, and specially such as either had been religious men, or favoured religious persons; for they banqueted and triumphed together that night, many wishing that that day had been seven year before; and some fearing lest he should escape, although he were imprisoned, could not be merry.
Others who knew nothing but truth by him both lamented him and heartily prayed for him.
But this is true that of certain of the clergy he was detestably hated, & specially of such as had borne swynge, and by his means was put from it; for in dead he was a man that in all his doings seemed not to favour any kind of Popery, nor could not abide the snoffyng pride of some prelates, which undoubtedly, whatsoever else was the cause of his death, did shorten his life and procured the end that he was brought unto.
We began to record anything that came to mind.
The benefit of working in this way – apart form the spontaneous atmosphere we created, was that I could pick and chose musicians for the particular style I wanted for each track.
...just doing anything we felt like doing at the time.
The engineer we used, Rhett Davies, also did Diamond Head and 801 Live and Quiet Sun, so it was like family.
There was a lot of experimenting and a lot of hours spent with Brian Eno, me, and Rhett in the control room doing all the things that eventually evolved into those cards, the Oblique Strategies, and it was just a lot of fun.
Typical ‘cranks’ are non-scientists who claim serious consideration for ideas that are considered unsupportable or outrageous according to the currently accepted views of the scientific community.
The cover of Led Zeppelin... shows the Hindenburg airship, in all its phallic glory, going down in flames.
The image did a pretty good job of encapsulating the music inside: sex, catastrophe and things blowing up.
I am just come from a long, dull, and consequently tiresome Opera of Handel’s, whose genius seems quite exhausted.
The only thing I liked in it was our Naples acquaintance, Celestina; who is not so pretty as she was, but sings better than she did.
We must be very careful when we speak of exercising "leadership" in Asia.
We are deceiving ourselves and others when we pretend to have answers to the problems, which agitate many of these Asiatic peoples.
Furthermore, we have about 50% of the world's wealth but only 6.3 of its population.
This disparity is particularly great as between ourselves and the peoples of Asia.
In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment.
Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships, which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity without positive detriment to our national security. To do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and daydreaming; and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives.
We need not deceive ourselves that we can afford today the luxury of altruism and world benefaction... In the face of this situation we would be better off to dispense now with a number of the concepts which have underlined our thinking with regard to the Far East.
We should dispense with the aspiration to 'be liked' or to be regarded as the repository of a high-minded international altruism.
We should stop putting ourselves in the position of being our brothers' keeper and refrain from offering moral and ideological advice.
We should cease to talk about vague — and for the Far East — unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of the living standards, and democratization.
The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.
In the latter part of the coming autumn I shall have ready a new work a romance of adventure, founded upon certain wild legends in the Southern Sperm Whale Fisheries and illustrated by the authors own personal experience, of two years & more as a harpooneer I do not know that the subject treated of has ever been worked up by a romancer; or, indeed, by any writer in any adequate manner.

The sixth-generation design of the supercharger expands the 'sweet zone' of the compressor's effectiveness, broadening it to help make power lower in the rpm band.
The thrill of this moment keeps me from saying what I really feel.

Thank you.
There’s lot of promise here, of drama, action, comedy, etc, all wrapped up in a family-friendly series.
I produced my theories and made my experiments for the purpose of establishing an aid in forming a correct opinion and I realized with dismay that they are still considered by the majority as a substitute for common sense and experience.

Listeners suddenly find her engulfed in soundscapes that bear close relation to those used by Björk or Radiohead (featured elements ranging from electronics to symphony orchestra), which also means that this album's mood is radically different from all her previous albums.“
The official church had to respect the ascetic spirit to the extent of enjoining celibacy upon its priests, and of recognizing, or rather immuring, such of the laity as desired to live out the old ascetic ideal.
But the official teaching of Rome would not allow it to be the ideal and duty of every Christian.
Priscillian perished for insisting that it was such; and seven centuries later the Church began zu burn the Cathari by thousands because they took a similar view of the Christian life.

Here Comes The Sun was written at the time when Apple was getting like school, where we had to go and be businessmen, all this signing accounts, and ’sign this‘ and ’sign that‘.
Anyway, it seems as if winter in England goes on forever; by the time spring comes you really deserve it.
So one day I decided – I’m going to ’sag off‘ Apple, and I went over to Eric’s house: The relief of not having to go see all those dopey accountants was wonderful, and I was walking around the garden with one of Eric’s acoustic guitars and wrote Here Comes The Sun.

The images were from ‘Alice in Wonderland.’
It was Alice in the boat.
She is buying an egg and it turns into Humpty Dumpty.
The woman serving in the shop turns into a sheep and the next minute they are rowing in a rowing boat somewhere and I was visualizing that.
There was also the image of the female who would someday come save me a ‘girl with kaleidoscope eyes’ who would come out of the sky.
It turned out to be Yoko, though I hadn’t met Yoko yet.
So maybe it should be ‘Yoko in the Sky with Diamonds.’
As with The Lord of the Rings films, the music is lush and richly orchestral – with the occasional choir – utilizing similarly pastoral themes for the hobbits and rhythmic, suspenseful ones for the threatening creatures and characters .
The overall scope of Shore’s music isn’t quite as sweeping and epic as that for The Lord of the Rings, perhaps a natural reflection of the smaller scale of Bilbo's adventures with the ring when compared to its fuller story as laid out in Lord of the Rings.
Yet, it still has some grandeur and hits all the right emotional notes .
After all we went through together I had and still have great love and respect for him.

A new exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum is billed as “The Art of Video Games.”
Visitors will encounter beautiful production art, a chronological look at the major video-game platforms and their key games, tidbits of wisdom from various designers, and even a handful of games playable on giant public screens.
What they won’t find is much of a case that video games are, in fact, art.

5,000 spectators watched the 11th annual parade in 1970, with marchers who included the Black Panther, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Medusa, Wasp, Quicksilver, Vision, Captain America, and Havok.
Riding on a float were Thor and Sif, along with the Norn Queen.
The Red Skull hitched a ride on the float for no known thematic reason....
Also present were Nighthawk, Batman, and Captain Marvel — and probably a few other DC heroes that Fagan was discreet enough not to mention.
The parade kicked off, he noted, with the familiar cry of "Avengers Assemble!" and ended on the same note.

Being few in number, they were obliged to stick together; in Eisenhower’s blandly conformist America, all weirdoes were brothers until the opposite was proven
Let it be said that I am right rather than consistent.
You do not take a man who for years has been hobbled by chains, liberate him, bring him to the starting line of a race, saying, 'you are free to compete with all the others,' and still justly believe you have been completely fair...
We seek not just freedom but opportunity, not just legal equity but human ability, not just equality as a right and a theory, but equality as a fact and as a result.
I'd been wanting to do a track like Another One Bites The Dust for a while, but originally all I had was the line and the bass riff.
Gradually I filled it in and the band added ideas.

To oppose a landing, I recommend, firstly, that a gun vessel of light draught should be provided ... to dash in amongst an enemy’s boats whilst in the shallow water between the anchorage and the shore, to which the enemy’s ships could not obtain access.
Taking up a position in the boat channel at the mouth of the river, she would be very favourably placed for acting either to the north or the south, and for directing her fire also against the enemy’s ships, if desired.

The singers perform it very indifferently which is a great disadvantage to it; the airs too, for brevity's sake as the opera would otherwise be too long fall without any recitativ' intervening from one into another that tis difficult to understand till it comes by frequent hearing to be well known.
My own judgement is that is it a capital opera notwithstanding tis called a ballad one.

It was the opinion of Hasse, as well as of many other eminent professors, that whoever had not heard Carestini was inacquainted with the most perfect style of singing.
At first I wanted her to appear more military-like, wearing more blue and the like, but then Herb told me to have her display more female qualities, which turned out to be right because we could then see she was more apt to being both an executive and a woman.
Modules should be both open (for extension) and closed (for modification).
I had a regular wind-up stopwatch and I watched the film to ‘spot-in’ the music with the watch.
I wrote the timings down in my book, then I’d go to Abbey Road, make up a piece, record it.
The Opera goes no farther than the breaking of Alcina's Enchantment and contains an agreeable Allegory The Character of Alcina's Beauty, and Inconstancy proves the short Duration of all sublimary Enjoyments, which are lost as soon as attain'd
The large rating agencies helped promote the dramatic growth in structured finance over the past decade, and profited immensely by issuing ratings that pleased the investment banks that arranged these pools of securities, but betrayed the trust of investors who were led to believe that investment grade bonds were relatively safe.
For me the changes the entrepreneur initiates are always toward the hypothetical state of equilibrium; they are changes brought about in response to existing patterns of mistaken decisions, a pattern characterised by missed opportunities.
The entrepreneur, in my view, brings into mutual adjustment those discordant elements which resulted from prior market ignorance.
That this world under God shall have a new birth of freedom.
He always tended to extremes.
He had become rather an extremist rightwinger within 10 years.
It was almost more than I could bear when the newspaper dog Balto received a statue for his ‘glorious achievements’.
This picture is an indictment of gang rule in America and the callous indifference of the government to this constantly increasing menace to our safety and our liberty.
Every incident in this picture is a reproduction of an actual occurrence, and the purpose of this picture is to demand of the government: ‘What are you going to do about it?’
The government is your government.
What are YOU going to do about it?
We have likewise had two Operas, Etius and Sosarmes, the first most Masterly, the last most pleasing, and in my mind exceeding pretty: There are two Duetto’s which Ravish me, and indeed the whole is vastly Genteel; (I am sorry I am so wicked) but I like one good Opera better than Twenty Oratorio’s.
The source of Hip is the Negro, for he has been living on the margin between totalitarianism and democracy for two centuries
Without him I'd never reached this level: He taught me how to drive a ground effect car and helped me to progress throughout the season
On Tuesday last Signor Dominico Annibali, the celebrated Italian Singer lately arriv'd from Dresden, to perform in Mr. Handel's Opera in Coven-Garden, was sent for to Kensington, and had the Honour to sing several Songs before her Majesty and the Princesses, who express’d the highest Satisfaction at his Performance.
… when I described how they flew, I said that they flew like they take a saucer and throw it across the water.
Most of the newspapers misunderstood and misquoted that too.
They said that I said that they were saucer-like; I said that they flew in a saucer-like fashion.
What is the most resilient parasite?
An idea.
Resilient… highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it’s almost impossible to eradicate.
An idea is like a virus, resilient, highly contagious. The smallest seed of an idea can grow.
It can grow to define or destroy you.
On side one the Jimi Hendrix tribute of (Arthur Lee's) Vindicator gives way to an Otis Redding, from simple songs to rhythmic gutturals, although Lee the ironic popmeister sticks his head in twice, which makes the naive optimism of With a Little Energy seem a little less one-dimensional.
Different Lees contend for side two--Otis, Jimi, Arthur, the weirdo who thought of "Singing Cowboy," and sewer designer William DeVaughn, whose top-five hit from earlier this year Lee has the audacity to cover.
Lost Odyssey proves that a turn-based RPG still has merit in modern gaming.
While there is nothing in Lost Odyssey that will convert action-RPG fans, there is plenty to please those already singing in the choir.
Lost Odyssey creates several memorable characters and a somber setting that should please those sick of JRPGs that seem made for 10-year-olds.
In his contribution to Anglo-German relations following the Second World War, Bert Trautmann was a prime example of how football can be used to bring people together and forget their differences, one that FIFA is proud to follow in its social development work across the globe.
I think Grant has had his eyes opened, and is willing to admit now Virginia and Lee’s army is not Tennessee and Bragg’s army.
Without question, the phenomenon of Haruhiism will be here to stay and make it’s impact among the otaku fanbase.
I have personally never seen such success being achieved by a show, just 3 episodes in it’s initial run.
You don't write 'God Save The Queen' because you hate the English race, you write a song like that because you love them; and you're fed up with them being mistreated…
As more consumers have fears about security on the Internet, viruses and malware, they may be happy to opt for Apple's gated community.

I got the name Rigby from a shop in Bristol.
I was wandering round Bristol one day and saw a shop called Rigby.
And I think Eleanor was from Eleanor Bron, the actress we worked with in the film Help! But I just liked the name.
I was looking for a name that sounded natural.
Eleanor Rigby sounded natural.
A primary function of The Intercept is to insist upon and defend our press freedoms from those who wish to infringe them.
We are determined to move forward with what we believe is essential reporting in the public interest and with a commitment to the ideal that a truly free and independent press is a vital component of any healthy democratic society.
We believe the prime value of journalism is that it imposes transparency, and thus accountability, on those who wield the greatest governmental and corporate power.
Our journalists will be not only permitted, but encouraged, to pursue stories without regard to whom they might alienate.
I do remember using the board to overdrive a Leslie cabinet for the main riff in 'How Many More Times'.
It doesn't sound like a Leslie because I wasn't employing the rotating speakers.
Surprisingly, that sound has real weight.
The guitar is going through the board, then through an amp which was driving the Leslie cabinet.
It was a very successful experiment.
This is not a spring but more of an Arab winter.
Anyone who thought the Arab Spring was going to repair problems in the Arab countries was wrong...
Observers might entertain the fantasy that the Islamic parties in the Arab countries are moderate, but their leaders are not moderate and the expectation that fundamental flaws that characterize the Arab societies will be corrected under the rule of the Islamic parties is not going to be fulfilled."
Minister Yaalon also use the term "Arab winter" and criticized the parties who expressed enthusiasm over the events and claimed that "this is in fact the collapse of a Western conception.
The conception was based on ignorance, naiveté and a tendency towards wishful thinking...
This conception was also based on Western patronizing.
Alboin’s biography sketched in these chapters is in many respects closely modelled on my father’s own life
Doing Beautiful Night with Ringo wasn’t enough.
I wanted more fun.
So we jammed.
Daniel’s fresh vision makes him one of the most exciting directors of his generation.
We are thrilled to partner with him as he brings his unique voice to arguably the most universally resonant myth in storytelling.
"In object-based scripting, you typically use objects somebody else has already defined for you."
At first I could see nothing, the hot air escaping from the chamber causing the candle flame to flicker, but presently, as my eyes grew accustomed to the light, details of the room within emerged slowly from the mist, strange animals, statues, and gold – everywhere the glint of gold.
Measured by its results, San Jacinto was one of the decisive battles of the world.
The freedom of Texas (not part of the United States at the time) from Mexico won here led to annexation and to the Mexican-American War, resulting in the acquisition by the United States of the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, California, Utah and parts of Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas and Oklahoma.
Almost one-third of the present area of the American Nation, nearly a million square miles of territory, changed sovereignty.
It’s hard to recommend the BMW HP2 unless you really want one or you have the use of a lot of open land or desert.
BMW’s own R1200GS is better on the road, as is KTM’s 950/990 Adventure – and they’re much cheaper, more practical and, in most cases, as good as the HP2 off-road.
A few years later (after 1807) he became known as the great master of the game.

9wm is an X window manager which attempts to emulate the Plan 9 window manager 8-1/2 as far as possible within the constraints imposed by X. It provides a simple yet comfortable user interface, without garish decorations or title-bars.

The threat to cancel Mac Office 97 is certainly the strongest bargaining point we have, as doing so will do a great deal of harm to Apple immediately.
I also believe Apple is taking the threat very seriously.
he was suffering from such an abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the killing.
I reject her philosophy.
It’s an atheist philosophy.
It reduces human interactions down to mere contracts and it is antithetical to my worldview.
If somebody is going to try to paste a person’s view on epistemology to me, then give me Thomas Aquinas, who believed that man needs divine help in the pursuit of knowledge.
Kelso must indeed be the greatest horse in the world today.
It was the finest piece of racing I have ever seen.
Those things that have made Western society (especially America and Britain) great have been and are being eaten away from within by ideological elites and political-economic plunderers who are undermining the morality and institutional order on which our system of liberty and law has been based.
The whole thing is how strong you are and how much power you got and how fucking mean you are — that’s what makes you rise in the mob.
Every day’s a fucking struggle, because you don’t know who’s looking to knock you off, especially when you become a captain or boss.
Every day, somebody’s looking to dispose of you and take your position.
You always got to be on your toes. Every fucking day is a scam day to keep your power and position.
As the Allman Brothers’ biggest hit, “Ramblin Man” stands alongside Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Sweet Home Alabama” as one of the definitive Southern rock songs.
It’s an amiable, laid-back tune, falling halfway between blues-rock and country-rock, graced with wonderful guitar harmonies… like a lot of Southern rock and hard rock classics of the ’70s, it was covered by local bands and rarely cut by recording artists; but, through repeated radio play and bar-band covers, it became an indisputable Southern rock classic.
the most satisfying TV series in years is an utterly gripping, triumphant realisation of Hugo Blick’s vision.
Actually, one of the rumors that I heard was that I overdosed or killed myself or something, but no.

Barlow’s first solo LP proper since 1999 showcase a very, very good songwriter indeed, someone who knows how to knock up a sturdy verse, bridge, chorus and middle-eight as readily as any lauded 1970s troubadour.
Some lyrics touch on the subject of Barlow’s clinical depression after leaving Take That, like the rather ponderous, drumless ballad Dying Inside. But generally, these songs tend to work as self-medication, as exhortations to transform your life – the best example being Jump, a rather lovely ballad co-written with Keane's Tim Rice-Oxley.
Since I Saw You Last resounds with exuberant pop rock songwriting, including latest single Let Me Go, Requiem (co-written with reconciled Take That buddy Robbie Williams) and Face To Face (a glammy stomper with Elton John).
It’s catchy and unabashedly mainstream, and it also feels like a moment he’s been waiting for.
If they promoted it, then we’d owe the record company for it.
So we’re in kind of a good situation.
We get enough money to put out our fucking records, they don’t care WHAT we do on the record.
We don’t get censored at all.
They put it out, send it around the world, and they don’t expect anything from us.
It’s kind of a good situation.
It wasn’t that Christopher Walken was the first choice—if he didn’t want to do it, it wasn’t really an idea.

It is now my suggestion that many people may not want information, and that they will avoid using a system precisely because it gives them information.
The chief thing to remember is that all these soups … must be made with plain water.
When made with the addition of stock they lose all character and cease to be what they were intended to be.
The fresh pleasant taste is lost owing to the addition of meat stock, and the value of the soup from an economical point of view is also lost.
told by persons who heard this opera performed when it first came out, that Senesino never sung or acted better, or more to the satisfaction of the public, than in this scene.

works of the last three centuries have been religiously restored in all their hideous deformity, while original and perfect works of the earlier and better period have been ruthlessly destroyed to make way for unauthorised and unnecessary features.

I came up with a few songs that felt and sounded really good, but I knew they weren't right stylistically for Linkin Park.
They were darker and moodier than anything I'd come up with for the band.
So I decided to work on them on my own rather than turn them over and have them transformed into Linkin Park tracks.
The United States does not recognize the right of a coastal nation to apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign aircraft not intending to enter national airspace nor does the United States apply its ADIZ procedures to foreign aircraft not intending to enter U.S. airspace.
Accordingly, U.S. military aircraft not intending to enter national airspace should not identify themselves or otherwise comply with ADIZ procedures established by other nations, unless the United States has specifically agreed to do so.

Anyway, in Bermuda, what suddenly dawned on me was everything I was taking for granted.
Valdivia, situated at some distance from the coast, on the Calle-calle river, is a German town.
Everywhere you meet German faces, German signboards and placards alongside the Spanish.
There is a large German school, a church and various Vereine, large shoe-factories, and, of course, breweries...
Usually anything with lots of notes was mine and anything with chunky chords was Page's.
Things like 'Good Times Bad Times', those are my sort of riffs, they're quite busy.
The pattern of the logistical arrangements made for deportations and the coordination of actions by the Yugoslav army, paramilitary groups and the police shows that this huge expulsion of Kosovo-Albanians was systematic and deliberately organized.
The NATO air campaign did not provoke the attacks on the civilian Kosovar population but the bombing created an environment that made such an operation feasible.
...in many ways it challenges the very conventions of pop music and the essence of innovation.
What is it all for?
I think that ‘Dare!’ is one of the great popular music LPs.
Unfortunately, it does not go without saying that in our examination we must avoid the fallacy that in the last decades has frequently been used as a substitute for the reductio ad absurdum: the reductio ad Hitlerum.
A view is not refuted by the fact that it happens to have been shared by Hitler.
If in doubt – do it.
Four years ago, I believed that I could be one of the World’s fastest sprinters.
I was cracking the top 20 in numerous World Cups and saw medals in my sights.
Over the next four seasons, I would have identical results each year.
There was no major improvement and I was getting older.
I now know that I will never be the fastest man on the World Cup, and that is fine.
Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It’s a big dick.
It’s a wrench.
It’s also what it sounds like: It’s a verb, it’s a digging factor. It’s an active process of searching, as in use us, we are a shovel, we are the match, we’re the blotter of acid, your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is you need to find out, or whatever it is you’re trying to achieve.
Now it happened on a certain time that a traveller from far countries, a man of great curiosity, was by desire of strange lands and the ways and dwellings of unaccustomed folk brought in a ship as far west even as the Lonely Island, Tol Eressea in the fairy speech, but which the Gnomes’ call Dor Faidwen, the Land of Release, and a great tale hangs thereto.

My mother's side were big into music, more than my dad's side.
My mother is a singer and she plays the guitar.
She recorded an album of her own actually two years ago.
And it was her brothers and sisters that kind of got me into music.
At those family nights there was a good bit of Tom Waits, a bit of Dylan.
Most of the singers would be female, my aunts, and they would sing Tracy Chapman and Joni Mitchell.
I think most people are not used to having no lyrics to focus on.
Lyrics are a real comfort to some people.
I guess they like to sing along and when they can't do that with us they can get a bit upset.
There was also something called the jus primae noctis which would probably not be mentioned in a textbook for children.
It was the law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories.
meat inspires strong feelings of revulsion and disgust because of its origin in living animals Because it is the product of the death of animals, meat is also more strongly linked than any other food to rottenness and pollution.
All the girls that came out in the last couple of years, we all got thrown into one bucket.

in the midst of everything else that has happened lately, tom, travis, and i have all spoken together. first through a number of phone calls, and then a couple of weeks ago we all hung out for a few hours. they’ve all been great, very positive conversations. we’re just reconnecting as friends after four years of not talking. it’s a good thing. obviously the first question for a lot of people will be “does this mean a blink-182 reunion?” the answer is none of us know. we haven’t talked about it at all. right now it’s just good for the three of us to see one another, reconnect, and let the past be the past. the events of the past two months supersede everything that happened before. life is too short.
Yesterday I was at the rehearsal of the new opera composed by Handel: I like it extremely, but the taste of the town is so depraved, that nothing will be approved of but the burlesque.
The Beggar’s Opera entirely triumphs over the Italian one.
I have not yet seen it, but everybody that has seen it, says it is very comical and full of humour.
Interplay had been a great place to work, and we felt that it was losing a lot of what we felt was great about it, and that they were making a lot of bad decisions that would destroy the company.
We were about five or six years early on that, but we saw the writing on the wall.
If Baldur's Gate hadn't hit big, Interplay might well have imploded much earlier, but we left about a year before BG was even released.
It is about death and suffering and that is what Iraqis have now.
The rage of the street comes out through our music.
I went forth to seek the challenge, to move towards the sounds of guns, to go where the danger was greatest, for there is where the issues would be resolved and the decisions where made

Mr. Handel, who has been some time indisposed with the rheumatism, is in so fair a way of recovery, that it is hoped he will be able to accompany the opera of Justin on Wednesday next, the 4th of May; at which time we hear their Majesties will honour that opera with their presence.
Earlier he had shared in the intellectual life of the émigré generation .
Now he entered fully into the mainstream of American scholarship.
This action has been taken in order for the Army to reevaluate its priorities for small caliber weapons, and to incorporate emerging requirements identified during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.
The Government will also incorporate studies looking into current capability gaps during said reevaluation.

To those who have questions in their minds about the reasons for accepting the temporary, voluntary suspension of some of the nuclear activities in this period the accomplishments included the completion of the Isfahan uranium conversion facility; the assembly and construction of centrifuges; the Arak heavy-water reactor; continued activity for building a 40-megawatt reactor; the completion of the Natanz underground facility; the production of yellowcake; and the building of the P2 centrifuge.
I (Name) do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.
I PROPOSE to speak about fairy-stories, though I am aware that this is a rash adventure.
Faerie is a perilous land, and in it are pitfalls for the unwary and dungeons for the overbold.
And overbold I may be accounted, for though I have been a lover of fairy-stories since I learned to read, and have at times thought about them, I have not studied them professionally.
I have been hardly more than a wandering explorer (or trespasser) in the land, full of wonder but not of information.
To say to the painter, that Nature is to be taken as she is, is to say to the player, that he may sit on the piano.
Moanin' is one of hard bop's seminal albums due to the extremely high quality of the personnel and compositions featured.
The mastery with which Lee Morgan and Benny Golson provide the frontline is further elevated by the solidarity of Timmons, Merritt, and Blakey.
It is a testament to the great quality of the performers, compositions, and the hard bop genre.
The accessibility of the album is surely a result of Art Blakey's desire to promote jazz as an art at a time when public interest in the music was waning, and the genre as a whole was threatened by the popularity of emerging musical styles such as doo-wop and rock and roll.
I write about love and honour and courage and the spiritual and I get dismissed as a hack and slay writer.
There are two golden rules for an orchestra: start together and finish together.
The public doesn't give a damn what goes on in between.
Although there is a generation that is very familiar with book, if you are over 40, then you probably haven’t, and we need to reach them.
To The rare Few, who early in Life, have rid Themselves of the Friendship of the Many, these pathetic Papers are inscribed

She rests at last beneath the starry skies.
The question in every case is whether the words used are in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.
I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.
At the behest of our leader Herzl, I came to Basle to make preparations for the Zionist Congress.
Among many other problems that occupied me then was one which contained something of the essence of the Jewish problem. What flag would we hang in the Congress Hall?
Then an idea struck me. We have a flag — and it is blue and white.
The talith (prayer shawl) with which we wrap ourselves when we pray: that is our symbol.
Let us take this Talith from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations.
So I ordered a blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it.
That is how the national flag, that flew over Congress Hall, came into being.

Not since Bettie Page has a fetish model inspired such passion as covergirl Dita Von Teese.
I was thinking something similar, but that 'You Could Have It So Much Better' would have been even greater.
We talked about how we liked that idea a lot and that it was a real shame that the album wasn't going to have a title.
Then we started laughing when we realised that the album hadn't been manufactured yet and we could change it after all.
You know what I hate?

As the member of the Interim Administration responsible for foreign affairs, I should like to inform the Council that, taking into account all relevant considerations, an international security force could be deployed under Chapters VI or VII of the Charter.
The place of his abode and where he hath been oftentimes seen, is called Henham, but most commonly Henham on the Mount, the town standing upon a hill, having many fair farms and granges belonging to it, in one of which named The Lodge, near to a wood called Birch-wood, by reason of the many birches growing there, in a pasture-ground close by the same, hath this monstrous Serpent been often seen upon the sides of a Bank, beaking and stretching himself out upon the same at such time as Sol did parch the earth with his refulgent beams.
three songs made by Mr. Handel with the Chorus at the end of each of them.

The pouty title alone drew giggles at Del Rey’s Bowery gig, but the song itself proves to be one of the more durable tracks here even if its lyrics start to get redundant ("baby you da best… kiss me hard before you go.")

Okay, we had it there a minute ago … I think he’s passed off to our right
A History of Western Philosophy errs consistently in this respect.
Its author never seems to be able to make up his mind whether he is writing history or polemic.... confers on philosophers who are dead and gone a kind of false contemporaneity which may make them seem important to the uninitiate.
But nevertheless it is a misreading of history.
Most of the RPGs we've created had their main focus on story and cutscenes, but I think that approach has reached a dead end.
This project got its start because we wanted to return to basics -- we just wanted to create a fun adventure.
Where would be without the Statue of Liberty?
For decades it has towered or crumbled above the wastelands of deserted arth—giants have uprooted it, aliens have found it curious … the symbol of Liberty, of optimism, has become a symbol of science fiction’s pessimistic view of the future.
A friend of mine once told me that Ozzy Osbourne's genius isn't that he's splendid musician or songwriter, but that he surrounds himself with people who are.
That definitely seems to be the case with "Scream," in which Ozzy has surrounded himself with the best bunch of players and songwriters since the halcyon days of "No More Tears".
Our philosophy is the acceptance of life for the transformation of life and also for the manifestation of God’s Light here on earth, at God’s choice Hour, in God’s own Way.
To me, everything is about being able to build awesome product ... Any game which does not push the state of the art leaves an opportunity for a competitor's game to look better.
I believe there were no gas chambers I think that 200,000 to 300,000 Jews perished in Nazi concentration camps but none of them by gas chambers.

The social work profession promotes social change, problem solving in human relationships and the empowerment and liberation of people to enhance well-being.
Utilising theories of human behaviour and social systems, social work intervenes at the points where people interact with their environments.
Principles of human rights and social justice are fundamental to social work.
The best martial arts movies are well-oiled stupid fun.
"Best of the Best 2" fits the bill, not only because it's the sequel to a decent original but because it further lives up to its name by borrowing bits and pieces from other genre films.
An initiative measure adopted by the voters deserves great respect.
The considered views and opinions of even the most highly qualified scholars and experts seldom outweigh the determinations of the voters.
When challenged, however, the voters’ determinations must find at least some support in evidence.
This is especially so when those determinations enact into law classifications of persons.
Conjecture, speculation and fears are not enough.
Still less will the moral disapprobation of a group or class of citizens suffice, no matter how large the majority that shares that view.
The evidence demonstrated beyond serious reckoning that Proposition 8 finds support only in such disapproval.
As such, Proposition 8 is beyond the constitutional reach of the voters or their representatives.
This album is also a ‘requiem’ for our planet.
We don't want to be negative or cynical about the fate of humanity, but the situation on Earth is growing critical, and the way humans behave is so catastrophic that we really need to express our exasperation about it.
It's not fear, but anger.
But we still believe that consciousness can make a difference and that we can change things as human beings.
Batman is a triumph of design over story, style over substance – a great-looking movie with a plot you can’t care much about.
All of the big moments in the movie are pounded home with ear-shattering sound effects and a jackhammer cutting style, but that just serves to underline the movie’s problem, which is a curious lack of suspense and intrinsic interest.
I never took acid.
I smoked grass and tripped on it, but I never took acid.
I was afraid to take it.
The song's about a girl who hasn't decided whether she wants to stay with me or not.
It's pretty much one of those love songs.
Minister for the Emu War.
Let him get back to his emus.

he ceilings imposed serve the basic governmental interest in safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process without directly impinging upon the rights of individual citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion.
I’d always wanted to do a movie that was pure fucking, nothing else, the way Eat had been just eating and Sleep had been just sleeping.
So in October '68 I shot a movie of Viva having sex with Louis Waldon.
I called it just Fuck.
This is how we do things around here.
All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.
Sunday, May 24, 1829: Embarked on board the Sumatra bound to Manila, and thence to Macao, where I shall probably take up my residence for the next four years; and for you, my dear sister, shall this journal be kept.
I left home at five o'clock (in the morning) with feelings not to be described or imagined but by those who have been placed in a similar situation.
A broadcast licensee shall afford reasonable opportunity for discussion of conflicting views on matters of public importance.
The problem with Tarja’s voice is that it’s so forceful, it’s rather difficult to find the right music to support it without being drowned out or made to sound generic against such a force.
What Lies Beneath succeeds in this more often than not, but that issue is still problematic to Tarja making a classic record
A large part of the area between Asnelles and la Rivière will prove impassable even to lightly equipped infantry without vehicles.
Mr. Handel goes to spend the Summer in Germany, but comes back against Winter, and is to have Concerts of Musick next Season, but no Opera's.
On another level it’s a serious critique of what we love and what we don’t about horror movies.
I love being scared.
I love that mixture of thrill, of horror, that objectification/identification thing of wanting definitely for the people to be alright but at the same time hoping they’ll go somewhere dark and face something awful.
The things that I don’t like are kids acting like idiots, the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances.
Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had swung a little too far in that direction.
All our afternoon's progress had been uphill.
About five or half past we reached the summit, and all of a sudden the dense curtain of the forest parted and we looked down into a deep and beautiful gorge and out over a wide panorama of wooded mountains with their summits shining in the sun and their glade-furrowed sides dimmed with purple shade.
The gorge under our feet--called Allerheiligen--afforded room in the grassy level at its head for a cozy and delightful human nest, shut away from the world and its botherations, and consequently the monks of the old times had not failed to spy it out; and here were the brown and comely ruins of their church and convent to prove that priests had as fine an instinct seven hundred years ago in ferreting out the choicest nooks and corners in a land as priests have today.
The green green hills, the blue blue sky, blue sea, great golden SUN, yellow dandelions, the pink naked beauty of ripe boyhood, deathless free and happy, brimming with health.
This I must have.
Nothing less than this can ever satisfy me!
GIVE ME MY HEAVEN!
GIVE ME MY HEAVEN!
Thank you.
But our princess is in another castle! … Just kidding!
Ha ha ha!
Bye bye.
The course title ‘Concrete Mathematics’ was originally intended as an antidote to ‘Abstract Mathematics’, since concrete classical results were rapidly being swept out of the modern mathematical curriculum by a new wave of abstract ideas popularly called the ‘New Math’.
Abstract mathematics is a wonderful subject, and there’s nothing wrong with it: It’s beautiful, general and useful.
But its adherents had become deluded that the rest of mathematics was inferior and no longer worthy of attention.
The goal of generalization had become so fashionable that a generation of mathematicians had become unable to relish beauty in the particular, to enjoy the challenge of solving quantitative problems, or to appreciate the value of technique.
Abstract mathematics was becoming inbred and losing touch with reality; mathematical education needed a concrete counterweight in order to restore a healthy balance.
Presidents Kagame and Museveni are on the verge of becoming the godfathers of the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the continuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
They have indirectly given criminal cartels a unique opportunity to organize and operate in this fragile and sensitive region.
Freedom is what we do with what’s been done to us.
I've had to come out.
No straight person knows about coming out.
I've had to find a desire inside myself and follow it, even though it goes against the grain of all the social patterns around me.
That process of discovering, examining and trusting my own desire is formative.
Obviously one realizes the danger when working with animals of this caliber, I've weighed the pros and I've weighed the cons, and the pros far outweigh the cons.
When the Sanford Police Department arrived at the scene of the incident, Mr. Zimmerman provided a statement claiming he acted in self-defense which at the time was supported by physical evidence and testimony.
I really appreciated the musical direction – morose, athmospheric and very different to Three Imaginary Boys.
We weren’t thinking about commercialism or potential popularity at all. I pretty much followed Robert’s instructions.
Of insects here were but few sorts and among them only the ants were troublesome to us.
The headline has to appear in The Los Angeles Times: 'Former Times carrier boy starts World War III in Kosovo'.
If a state’s case against a condemned prisoner is not 'ironclad', should not that fact trouble those pursuing his execution?
Upon this dreary coast we have nothing but county meetings and shipwrecks; and I have this day dined upon fish, which probably dined upon the crews of several colliers lost in the late gales.
But I saw the sea once more in all the glories of surf and foam.
With believable chemistry together, Chiklis and Benz help create a solid TV couple and, let’s hope, no ordinary series.
It is true that on only a handful of occasions during all of the several hundred session tapes and thousands of recording hours can Ringo be heard to have made a mistake or wavered in his beat.
His work was remarkably consistent and excellent, from 1962 right through 1970.
Overall, the album is unlistenable.
Our remastering shows just how unlistenable.
I am unable to recommend that anyone part with their hard-earned pay for this one, unless they want to take it to parties and play it at unwelcome guests.
There are some “Lizard” lovers, I know.
They must be very strange.
Parts of this famous book are sketchy ... in other respects it is a marvellously readable, magnificently sweeping survey of Western thought, distinctive for placing it informatively into its historical context.
Russell enjoyed writing it, and the enjoyment shows; his later remarks about it equally show that he was conscious of its shortcomings.
Where some of the Gold Digger annuals from Warner have not been overburdened with heavy story material, the current musical opus gets moving with the advantage of a trim backstage yarn taken from Mystery of Life, the Broadway play by Richard Maibaum, Michael Wallach and George Haight.
Mr. Speaker, if there is no foundation to the doggie story, of course I am happy.
The fact nevertheless remains that in a statement by Drew Pearson in his radio broadcast a week ago, when he said that the President's trip cost the American taxpayers 20,000,000, has not been challenged or denied.
It’s a movie for everyone whose life has been thrown off-course, out of whack, or simply not turned out the way they planned it.
Newman s made a fine impression , writing a score that is not just a vibrant, very modern action thriller score – it’s also one that fits perfectly into this series – and one that is resolutely his own, completely undiluted by any desire to sound like someone else.
After all, that's what we did—came in and cooked.
Well, that was the thing I was most afraid of.
And if you’ve seen the trailer, my word.
I’m just telling everybody I know, ‘Don’t see the trailer, don’t see the trailer’.
Because it’s exactly what the trailer ends up making you think, is that it’s this glorified fantasy adventure with nothing but special effects, and that's not what we ended up with in this movie.
We’ve ended up with a movie about a friendship between a boy and a girl who develop an imaginary kingdom, and the girl dies, and the boy has to deal with his loss, which is the story of the book.
Y r Lord p’s information concerning M r Handel’s Disorder was y e first I received – I can assure Y r Lord p it gave me no Small Concern – when y e Fate of Harmony depends upon a Single Life, the Lovers of Harmony may be well allowed to be Sollicitous.

For more than half an hour thirty-eight respectable, law-abiding citizens in Queens watched a killer stalk and stab a woman in three separate attacks in Kew Gardens.
The last album I made was so laden with people telling me who I should sound like that I listen back now and think ‘Who’s that?’, but Since I Saw You Last was easy to make; there’s a lot of my life on this record.
Don’t worry about it.
There’s a sucker born every minute.
It’s hard to describe.
Like, describe the difference between Soundgarden and Alice in Chains, you know what I mean?
It’s almost impossible.
There are obvious things about it that when you listen to it, you’ll know it’s not a Linkin Park record.
You’re not gonna get confused.
You’ll have to hear it.
Of great concern to the United Nations and the international community are the continuing and disturbing reports of abuses being committed by security and non-uniformed elements, particularly at night during curfew, including raids on private homes, beatings, arbitrary arrests, and disappearances.
Laibach’s method is extremely simple, effective and horribly open to misinterpretation.
First of all, they absorb the mannerisms of the enemy, adopting all the seductive trappings and symbols of state power, and then they exaggerate everything to the edge of parody.Next they turn their focus to highly charged issues - the West’s fear of immigrants from Eastern Europe, the power games of the EU, the analogies between Western democracy and totalitarianism.
I see bodies like this with their faces blown away at close range in execution fashion and it's obvious people with no value for human life have done this.
Unfortunately, I do not have the words to describe my personal revulsion at the site of what can only be described as an unspeakable atrocity.
One hundred nations in the UN have not agreed with us on just about everything that's come before them where we're involved, and it didn't upset my breakfast at all.
Serbs are misusing the Albanians' goodwill to create an equal society for all.
They don't want to integrate in Kosovar society.
Proof of this is yesterday's and today's events.
Their will has remained in the previous five years only for violence against Albanians.
This can no longer be tolerated.
People of the Philippines, I have returned!
By the grace of Almighty God, our forces stand again on Philippine soil.
The Japanese phrase shikata ga nai, or ‘it can't be helped,’ indicates cultural norms over which one has little control… This notion of suffering in part stems from shikata ga nai: failing to follow cultural norms and social conventions led to a life of little choice but endurance of suffering.

You never come back and show the imprint of the mother.
It’s all by suggestion … I just wonder if coming back and seeing her form isn’t just sticking a knife in their hearts … He’s hunting his mother and he never finds her … It stops any awkward business of him seeing his mother’s form and start any extra crying.
Within a couple of days we were passing out rations like Santa Claus on his sleigh, with both giver and receiver on the move.
The trucks were like a band of stage coaches making a run through Indian territory.
We got used to keeping the wheels going, disregarding the snipers, and hoping we wouldn’t get lost or hit.
Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.
Senator, there is not enough thrust in all of Christendom to make a fighter out of the F-111
Wrote that at my house in St. John’s Wood.
All I remember is that I said, ‘It’s getting better all the time,’ and John contributed the legendary line ‘It couldn’t get much worse.’
Which I thought was very good.
Against the spirit of that song, which was all super-optimistic … then there’s that lovely little sardonic line.
Typical John.
Animal tales are stories in which human beings are not the main actors.
Animals, less commonly birds and fish, are the chief 'movers and shakers'.
If there is one classic way of Mick and me working together this is it.
I had the riff and chorus line, Mick got stuck into the verses.

Wild Horses was about the usual thing of not wanting to be on the road, being a million miles from where you want to be.
The Bismarck had put up a most gallant fight against impossible odds worthy of the old days of the Imperial German Navy, and she went down with her colours flying.

The loss of another great one has come upon us this week.
My heart is very sadness with the lost of a friend, there is no word that can express the grief and pain that I’m feeling in my heart right now.
Michael was a very influential and big part of my life since the very start of my life.
Michael thank you for giving me those priceless memories and allowing me to be part of your history and life!!
He took my childhood and a big part of my heart to heaven with him.
I will miss you!
The serialists were all there.
And so were the Americanists, both Aaron Copland's group and Virgil's.
And here was something that had come out of Boston that none of us had ever heard of and was completely different from either.
There was nearly a riot in the foyer - everybody shouting.
A real whoop-dee-doo.
Yeah, that might be nice, actually.
There’s only so far you can go without becoming pompous and a bit overblown, so we’ll tread that line very carefully.
Reset.
Recalibrate.
That we have not stopped the genocide means we have not learned from history
We always knew that Kosovo would not be invaded.
KFOR is in Kosovo to protect against civil violence, disturbances, and ethnic violence.
They don't need tanks but riot gear and shields, and soldiers trained in dealing with public disorder.
If KFOR was not prepared for such civil disorder, then why the heck not?
What did they think they were in Kosovo for?

But no person of honesty and vision can look on their pro-war policy here today without seeing the dangers involved in such a policy both for us and for them.
Instead of agitating for war, the Jewish groups in this country should be opposing it in every possible way for they will be among the first to feel its consequences.
Tolerance is a virtue that depends upon peace and strength.
History shows that it cannot survive war and devastations.
'Look on the branch above your head,' said the Gnat, 'and there you'll find a snap-dragon-fly.
Its body is made of plum-pudding, its wings of holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.'
'And what does it live on?' 'Frumenty and mince pie,' the Gnat replied; 'and it makes is nest in a Christmas box.'
'And then there's the Butterfly,' Alice went on, after she had taken a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to herself, 'I wonder if that's the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles -- because they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies!'
Yesterday Signor Caristina, a celebrated Singer in the late Opera's in Covent Garden Theatre, embarqued on Board a Ship for Venice.
We now realize, as we have never realized before, our interdependence with each other – that we cannot merely take but we must give as well.
To be perfectly honest, I was extremely disappointed that we did not get the chance to make the next Fallout game.
This has nothing to do with Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that Fallout was ours and it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it.
It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch.
Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.
Apollo 8, Houston.
What does the ole Moon look like from 60 miles?

SSI's once-glorious run of AD&D games ended on a note of bitter disappointment for fans.
After this game, SSI ceased to have the AD&D license, and it looked like AD&D was gone from the PC, at least for the immediate future.
Fans were left to wonder whether it was SSI's poor showing of recent AD&D games or TSR's own financial troubles that led to this quiet end of the AD&D franchise.
If Paris is France, then Coney Island, between June and September, is the World.
The only way to stop the killing is to take the weapons of war out of the hands of the international outlaws of North Vietnam.
Had a transcendental storm of colour visions today in the bus going to Marseilles.
We ran through a long avenue of trees and I closed my eyes against the setting sun.
An overwhelming flood of intensely bright colors exploded behind my eyelids: a multidimensional kaleidoscope whirling out through space.
I was swept out of time.
I was out in a world of infinite number.
The vision stopped abruptly as we left the trees.
Was that a vision?
What happened to me?
I’d like to believe that there is some truth in the figures, but in all honesty, they really don’t mean all that much and should not be taken very seriously.
The next day our manager called and informed us that, ‚as of today, Tom DeLonge is no longer a member of blink-182.‘ He said not to try and call Tom, that he had already changed his number and didn't want to talk to us.
And that is how it ended.
After 13 years of being in a band together, hundreds of thousand of miles toured, countless shows played, and seven albums released, Tom didn’t even call to quit the band.
He had his manager do it for him.
The character of the finale — that is, an elaborate compound piece made up of integrated recitatives, ariosos, and ensembles — is already present in Tamerlano, again showing Handel in the van despite his generally conservative adherence to the Venetian-Neapolitan operatic pattern.

There is nothing that anyone could have done to prevent this.
No one is to blame except me and voDKa .
Our actions are a two man war against everyone else.

The Music was as strange as the sound and I liked that about Brutal Truth.

Wolfgang Dauner is not as widely known outside Europe as he ought to be, but this striking reissue is a great starting place for those who are unfamiliar with his work.
We know of nothing in the line of portraiture that has ever been attempted in this city, or indeed in this country, that in any way approaches it.… This portrait of Dr. Gross is a great work—we know of nothing greater that has ever been executed in America.
Dear First Lady, I recently read your criticism of my family.
I was deeply hurt.
Heaven knows we're far from perfect and, if truth be known, maybe just a wee bit short from normal; but as Dr. Seuss says, 'a person is a person'.
I try to teach my children always to give somebody the benefit of the doubt and not talk badly about them, even if they're rich.
It's hard to get them to understand this advice when the very First Lady in the country calls us not only dumb, but 'the dumbest thing' she ever saw.
I hope there is some way out of this controversy.
I thought, perhaps, it would be a good start to just speak my mind.
If 24, Lost, and The 4400 had a baby, it would be The Event.
There had, it seems, been some truth in chimerical old Borellus when he wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain ‘Essential Saltes’ from which the shade of a long-dead living thing might be raised up.
Brilliant.
Awesome.
Spectacular.
Trouser-creamingly good.
I could go on and on.
But I won't.
Because if the phrase "best PlayStation action game yet" and what I've already written isn't enough to motivate you to get off your ass and rush down to your nearest software store to buy this, you don't deserve any more of my time.
I wanted to try to give the same thematic core that the original film had and speak about some of my own ideas about society.
I don’t think it’s underline message.
I think it’s like in your face!
Right upfront: The way society has been conditioned to think, that as long as you have this stuff, life is wonderful.
And being falsely attracted and seduced by things that really shouldn’t have value in your life, but do.
What John Gotti did was the beginning of the end of our thing.
I hate to see the sun go down / And squeeze itself into the ground / Since some warm night it might get stuck / And in the morning not get up.
(… ) If there wasn’t anything as manic as the high points of Rum Sodomy & the Lash or If I Should Fall from Grace with God, these sessions reveal the Pogues had found their feet and were sounding like a band again (… ).
MacGowan’s songwriting still hadn’t regained the fire and acidity that made the group’s first three albums so powerful, and Terry Woods and Jem Finer don’t quite pick up the slack.
And so, everybody's going to war But we don't know we're fighting for Don't tell me it's a worthy cause No cause could be so worthy
I was at the rehearsal of the charming Berenice this morning, when I received an inexpressible delight.
The overture is excellent a good fuge & after it a pleasing air in the taste of that at the end of the overture in Ariadne, with a sprightly air after it, which concludes this overture; the first act is mostly in the agreable strain, full of exquisite genteel airs & quite new.
The second is more in the great taste & may properly be call’d sublime.
The third act opens with a short but good prelude, & this act is a mixture both of great & pleasing.
Mr Handel is better though not well enough to play the harpsichord himself which young Smith is to do for him.
Pumped with fluid, inside your brain / Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes / Burning flesh, drips away / Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil / Frigid cold, cracks your limbs / How long can you last / In this frozen water burial? / Sewn together, joining heads / Just a matter of time / til you rip yourselves apart
At the end of February we were a congeries of disorderly panic-stricken mobs and factions.
In the hundred days from March to June we became again an organized nation confident of our power to provide for our own security and to control our own destiny.
A license permits broadcasting, but the licensee has no constitutional right to be the one who holds the license or to monopolize a frequency to the exclusion of his fellow citizens.
There is nothing in the First Amendment which prevents the Government from requiring a licensee to share his frequency with others.
It is the right of the viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount.
John Coltrane's matchup with singer Johnny Hartman, although quite unexpected, works extremely well.
Hartman was in prime form… and his versions of "Lush Life" and "My One and Only Love" have never been topped.
Coltrane's playing throughout the session is beautiful, sympathetic, and still exploratory… .. At only half an hour, one wishes there were twice as much music, but what is here is classic, essential for all jazz collections.
Nelson Mandela will stay in our hearts forever.
The memories of his remarkable fight against oppression, his incredible charisma and his positive values will live on in us and with us.

We are to have a new deputy.Oh, by my soul, it is a Talbot, and he will cut every Englishman's throat.Now Tyrconnell is come ashore, and we shall have commissions galore, and everyone that won't go to Mass, he will be turned out to look like an ass. Now the heretics all go down, by Christ and St Patrick the nation's our own.

It’s about getting through life’s obstacles and all the tests that fate may throw at you in the process.
It’s trying to convince you that you have the strength to get through whatever trials and tribulations may come your way.
It’s supposed to inspire hope.
The ‘essence of what happens’ - that’s what matters.
why should not I call my works symphonies, arrangements, harmonies, nocturnes, and so forth?
I know that many good people whose sense of humour is not very capacious think my nomenclature funny and myself eccentric....But what do not they give me credit for meaning something, and knowing what I mean.
Social CRM is a philosophy and a business strategy, supported by a technology platform, business rules, workflow, processes and social characteristics, designed to engage the customer in a collaborative conversation in order to provide mutually beneficial value in a trusted and transparent business environment.
It's the company's response to the customer's ownership of the conversation.
His voice was at first a powerful and clear soprano, which afterwards changed into the fullest, finest, and deepest counter-tenor that has perhaps ever been heard Carestini's person was tall, beautiful, and majestic.
He was a very animated and intelligent actor, and having a considerable portion of enthusiasm in his composition, with a lively and inventive imagination, he rendered every thing he sung interesting by good taste, energy, and judicious embellishments.
He manifested great agility in the execution of difficult divisions from the chest in a most articulate and admirable manner.
It was the opinion of Hasse, as well as of many other eminent professors, that whoever had not heard Carestini was inacquainted with the most perfect style of singing.
for the Court considers it as amounting to an overriding general principle of law that, in the absence of express provision to the contrary, an attribution of territory must ipso facto carry with it the waters appurtenant to the territory attributed;
The raw material we work with emanates directly from our amps, seeing how the amps will respond differently according to how we position ourselves in front of them to achieve, for example, a more droning effect, or harsher feedback… So we can’t really write a song unless we’re in front of stacks of loud amps.
Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.
It had the Fifties-ish sound because I have never really written a song that sounded like that period, although that was my period, the music I identified with.
The great diapason tone, an the whole, is rather weak but very beautiful, and the 16ft flues have rather a tendency to predominate.
If, however, the diapason tone of the swell, choir and solo is added, the general diapason tone is vastly improved.
The chorus reeds are voiced very loudly and are rather brassy, no greater wind pressure than 6 in. being employed, even for the solo organ.
In England we are used to the smooth-toned reeds and heavy pressures of our great modern organ builders.
The solo trompettes en chamade in this instrument strike through the rest of this organ wonderfully well.
It was a new conception in architectural writing though it has since become so general, that we tend to forget that it was an innovation which we owe to him.
Instead of composing an litarary essay accompanied by illustrations, he planned to make the illustrations the main body of the work, each to be providing with a commentary more or less brief as the nature of the case demanded, the ideal being one page of text opposite or accompanying each drawing.
Well, the Graspop Metal Meeting of 2006 was another total disaster.
The technician we had back then didn't even tune the guitar, and no monitoring was done properly.
We didn't hear anything, but hey, fuck.
Any player coming to Spurs, whether he's a big signing or just a ground staff boy, must be dedicated to the game and to the club.
He must never be satisfied with his last performance, and he must hate losing.
I have done three good things since I have commenced: I have spared Boulton's life at your instance, I pardoned Gaddy, and now I shall shoot Scott.
Last note of song is my guitar being sick — well so would you if I smashed your guts for 2:28.

… if you watch MTV for too long, it’s a bit like hell – there’s nothing of substance there.
So we got this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that.
All five murders no doubt were committed by the same hand.
In the first four the throats appear to have been cut from left to right, in the last case owing to the extensive mutilation it is impossible to say in what direction the fatal cut was made, but arterial blood was found on the wall in splashes close to where the woman’s head must have been lying. All the circumstances surrounding the murders lead me to form the opinion that the women must have been lying down when murdered and in every case the throat was first cut.
I’ve never recognized ‘emo’ as a genre of music.
I always thought it was the most retarded term ever.
I know there is this generic commonplace that every band that gets labeled with that term hates it. They feel scandalized by it.
But honestly, I just thought that all the bands I played in were punk rock bands.
The reason I think it’s so stupid is that – what, like the Bad Brains weren’t emotional? What – they were robots or something?
It just doesn’t make any sense to me.
The two opera houses are, neither of them, in a successful way; and it is the confirmed opinion that this winter will compleat your friend Handel’s destruction, as far as the loss of his money can destroy him.
Yes, I am a terrorist and I am proud of it.
And I support terrorism so long as it was against the United States Government and against Israel, because you are more than terrorists; you are the one who invented terrorism and using it every day.
The evidence is far too weak to support the reality of the G-spot.
Specifically, anecdotal observations and case studies made on the basis of a tiny number of subjects are not supported by subsequent anatomic and biochemical studies.
When one German soldier was shot and one seriously wounded in Pancevo, Wehrmacht soldiers and the Waffen SS rounded up about 100 civilians at random...the town commander, Lt. Col. Fritz Bandelow conducted the Court's Martial...The presiding judge, SS-Sturmbannführer Rudolf Hoffmann sentenced 36 of those arrested to death.
On April 21, 1941, four of the civilians were the first to be shot...On the following day eighteen victims were hanged in a cemetery and fourteen more were shot at the cemetery wall by an execution squad of the Wehrmacht's Grossdeutschland regiment.
Whoopee!
Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.
I have been playing chess for over fifty years.
I started when I was ten years old, and I am still going strong.
In all that time I don't believe a day has gone by that I have not played at least one game of chess – and I still enjoy it as much as ever.
Our nation has lost its greatest son.
Our people have lost a father.
Although we knew that this day would come, nothing can reduce the sense of our profound loss.
the game breaks no new ground, but if you stick with it, you'll find a compelling emotional drama, delicate adjustments to an age-old formula, and a unique and balanced skill-development system.
Why in the very room I'll bet we have writers, costumers, electronic hobbyists, live steam enthusiasts, corset makers, artists, blacksmiths, scrap bookers, photographers, musicians, and people who engage in every other creative endeavor you can imagine!
Mr Murphy says there will be no strike.

Not only is there to be a strike on the trams we are going to win this struggle no matter what happens.
true alpine style is without any kind of preparation or recce’s
He could have been a distinguished painter and would have been one under a luckier star, but two things told fatally against him. He never needed to work, and he was cursed with a sense of diffidence and a feeling that whatever he did would be contrasted unfavourable with his father's work If he had had to depend upon himself and had worked in his own way, I do not believe that what he feared would have happened.
There is a cool, mannered elegance to the picture that I like, but it's dead at its center.
There is no feeling that real feelings are at risk here.
Tyler seems sincere enough, but Fiennes withholds too well.
Peter and I usually write very quickly.
It’s usually a day or two a song, but for some reason this didn’t really hit us as a hit song.
We didn’t give up on it.
We just kept working on it over the course of a year.
Thank God we did.
It was the first song that was cut on the True Blue album.
It made me nervous as a writer, because a lot of times the very first song that gets cut doesn’t make it in the long run.
But the song ended up making the album, which really opened up a lot of doors for me
I guess it bothers people that it’s not grammatically correct, but I think I’m allowed to do whatever I want.
During the inauguration conference of the Taiwan-Tibet Exchange Foundation in 2003, I announced our new policy and emphasized that the Taiwan government will no longer treat people of the Tibetan government-in-exile as Chinese people.
Instead, we will handle our relations with Tibet and China separately under this fresh perspective on our relations with Tibet.
Whatever anyone may have thought, the truth is I never gave Edie a drug, ever.
Not even one diet pill.
Nothing.
She certainly was taking a lot of amphetamine and downs, but she certainly wasn’t getting them from me.
She was getting them from that doctor who was shooting up every Society lady in town.
You may say Christ saith this, and the apostles say this, but what canst thou say?
Art thou a child of the Light and hast thou walked in the Light, and what thou speakest is it inwardly from God?
The best way I can explain the song is a ‘huge explosion of celebration’.
’May’ is a horror film and something more and deeper, something disturbing and oddly moving.
Few Iranian films have tried to realistically depict both the urban middle and lower classes, and fewer still with the complexity of story telling and depth of characterization in Asghar Farhadi's impressive third feature, ‘Fireworks Wednesday’. this beautifully paced drama about marital infidelity, seen through the eyes of a young housemaid about to get married, is psychologically intricate and dramatically engrossing.
It ain't a song until you sing it.
The ‘Story of the Three Bears’ is a very old Nursery Tale, but it was never so well told as by the great poet Southey, whose version I have (with permission) given you, only I have made the intruder a little girl instead of an old woman.
This I did because I found that the tale is better known with Silver-Hair, and because there are so many other stories of old women.
Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy.I knew Jack Kennedy.Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine.
Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy!
Animated combo of laughs and life lessons charts its heroine’s adventures in such an accessible and cheery way, it’s easy to imagine her leaping into a Stateside remake.
I didn’t not like it.
But I liked it the way we did it better.
reason I have (the dollar sign), ’cause it’s ironic.
Like, I don’t care.
I was so happy being broke.
And I’m happy not being broke.
It doesn’t really affect me either way.
I care about taking care of people that have taken care of me — that’s important to me.
But to be honest, I’m kind of repulsed by the gluttony and excesses of a lot of people in the limelight.
They came in here and said, ‚Here’s the idea: 40-year-old guy, crossroads of his life, turmoil in his marriage, turmoil in his professional career, beginning to raise teenage kids in modern society—all the pressures of every man in his generation.
The only difference is he’s the Mob boss of northern New Jersey.
Oh, by the way, he’s seeing a shrink.‘
The findings can be considered evidence for what those who have undergone ex-gay therapy say about it, but nothing more.
Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?
the hands of the Valar themselves … had wrestled the great mountains asunder, and the sides of the rift were sheer as if axe-cloven.
To be sure, in our world there remain outposts of tyranny – and America stands with oppressed people on every continent … in Cuba, and Burma, and North Korea, and Iran, and Belarus, and Zimbabwe.
If Trevor had been on marijuana instead of drink while we were in Dingle he would have been a lot happier.
You could tell immediately if Trevor was on dope or alcohol.
He was so divinely easy and joyful on marijuana and so cantankerous on drink.
I could always tell what Trevor had been taking.
Marijuana suited him in a way that booze never did.
I have not found anyone in Russian law enforcement or elsewhere who actually says ‘yes, the brother’s circle is an organization and it exists.
As such the label Brothers' Circle could be seen as an attempt to connect disparate criminal gangs.
As I started adapting it, it was the story of an economic crisis, and it was an economic crisis in an economy that was funded by gambling – and the crisis occurred due to a failure in regulation.
It just seemed to have something that you couldn’t ignore.
You are right!
He was not like that at all.
His character was considerably toned down.
I think they're great – I think they're better than us.
He never flinched.
He never felt sorry for himself.
He never lost his sense of humor.
He wasn’t afraid of death, his own mortality, although he was very aware of it.
He wasn’t even attached to his body, if you know what I mean.
We’d be in the kitchen and he’d say, ‘Dhan, you know we are not these bodies, don’t you?’
The best way to view the Enhanced Edition is as a particular flavour of this game - one which may or may not appeal to your personal taste.
I certainly can't claim that this is the definitive version of Baldur's Gate and I have to judge this game I love with that in mind.
It's not better - it's just different.
We just weren’t Riot Grrls.
We had nothing to do with that movement, we never did, and when we went on our first big tour of Europe, every single promotor said, “Riot Grrls, from Seattle!”
We weren’t doing it for political reasons the way the Riot Grrls were.
We had a lot of respect for the Riot Grrls and people like Kathleen Hanna We were supportive of them and what they were doing, it wasn’t that we thought that the Riot Grrls were bad.
(a) Each person has the same indefeasible claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme of liberties for all; and (b) Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: first, they are to be attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and second, they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (the difference principle).
And so, in India, you know, the lighter or more fair skin you are, you’re supposedly considered more beautiful.
And I grew up with that, you know, in my own household because my parents are from India.
So my family would always say, oh, don’t go out in the sun, you’re going to get too dark, or things like that.
But then with my peers, they would say, oh, my goodness, you’re so tan.
Your skin is so beautiful. And it’s really sad that we always try to attain those ideals that aren’t important.
but he talked too much of himself, of what he could to and of what ought to be done; and he indulged, contrary to good discipline and all propriety, in very free comments upon superiors and fellow-commanders.
I've always embraced my hard-core roots, but becoming a household name was an important thing to me.
(Compromiso, Article XII (3))— that in so far as any special steps are necessary to be taken for the execution of the present Decision, they shall be taken by the Parties, and the Decision shall be executed, within a period of 9 months from the date on which, after ratification by Her Britannic Majesty's Government, it is communicated by the latter to the Parties, together with the Declaration constituting it the Award specified in Article XIII (1) of the Compromiso;
And really, if you don't have at least a tolerance for moe content then this series, like the others, is absolutely not for you.
Before the Beginning, after the great celestial war that rocked the very foundation of Heaven and Hell, God and Satan established an uneasy truce.
Never again would they face each other in direct confrontation.
So God created the Earth, inhabiting it with the crafty ape he called Man.
And henceforth, to each generation was born a creature of Light and a creature of Darkness, and they would gather to them men of ilk nature and thus, by proxy, carry on the war between Good and Evil.
We said to ourselves, 'we complain so much about New York—about the busy streets, about the crowds and the pushing, about the subway system—but I would trade that for anything right now.'
Before we left the hotel that night, we knew we would write a song about our city.
The mandate of Francisco Franco has meant the longest period of prosperity and peace that our country has known for many centuries.
Our members span an amazing political spectrum, which includes but is not limited to: Libertarians, Liberals, Conservatives, Republicans, Democrats, Reform Party members, Independents, Capitalists, Socialists, Communists, Stalinists, Leninists, Trotskyites, Maoists, Zionists, Monarchists, Fascists, Anarchists, and just about anything else you could possibly imagine.
The Church of Satan does not have an “official” political position.
The Church of Satan is not going to demand that members conform to any particular political point of view, nor should our members expect the Church to assist them in forcing others to assent to their own positions.
The emotional drive to “change the world” is a common stage of early adult development typically beginning around age 16 and lasting until around age 24.
Usually, individuals who become aware as to how the world actually functions—rather than being lost in a fantasy wherein they will be some sort of savior figure—come to realize that idealism (such as changing the world) is less important than the principle of getting what you want for yourself.
That latter position should be an obvious development particularly for Satanists since we don’t hide our understanding that Satanists tend to be lone wolves and not herd animals.
Because Satanism is intended to respect reality as it is (and not as anyone thinks it “should” be), it usually does not take long for a truly aware Satanist to set aside politics in favor of direct, personal efforts for selfish goals.
I was at Arminius last Saturday where I had the pleasure to meet many of our musical friends Handel has a much larger orquestre than last year & the loss of Castrucio is abundantly supplied by Martini who plays immediately above Clegg where Castrucio us’d to sit.
The overture is a very fine one & the fuge I think as far as I can tell at once hearing not unlike to that in Admetus it ends with a minuet strain The first song is a duet between Annibali & Strada & is but short but like the whole piece in every respect excellent & vastly pleasing.
To tell you my real opinion of Annibali I found him widely different from the idea I had conceiv’d of him but it was on the right side that I was mistaken for he prodigiously surpass’d my expectations.
His voice it must be confess’d is not so good as some we have had the lower noates of it are very weak & he has not the melowness of Senesino but the middle part of it is clear strong & manly & very tunable. he is by far a greater master of musick than any man I ever heard sing on a stage.
He is as exact in his time as Caporali who plays the base though he sings with the greatest ease imaginable & his closes are superiour to them all he comes to them in the most natural rational way always keeps within the air & scarce ever makes two alike throughout the opera.
One is never in any pain about him he enters so thoroughly into what he is about both as to action as well as the song.
His action indeed is incomparable & he sings with all the passion his voice will admitt. — Upon the whole he pleases me the best of any singer I ever heard without exception.
I need but mention Strada’s name you know her excellencies She has a charming part.
As for Conti he sings I think better than last year Martini has a solo upon the hautboy with only Conti singing to it.
Indeed Martini exerts himself mightily through the whole opera.
Beard has but two though two too many songs for he is absolutely good for nothing: Bertolli’s & Negri’s songs are pleasing firm compositions & they perform them extremely well.
The base has but one song.
The opera is rather grave but correct & labour’d to the highest degree & is a favourite one with Handel.
The bases & accompaniment if possible is better than usual.
But I fear ’twill not be acted very long.
The Town dont much admire it.
P:S Mr Handel has just this minute been with me he is in high spirits and tells me he has now ready & compleated two more operas & can have something else this winter besides if there is occasion.
We’d been watching the penguins and filming them for days, without a hint of what was to come.
But then the weather took a turn for the worse.
It was quite amazing. Rather than getting together in a huddle to protect themselves from the cold, they did something quite unexpected, that no other penguins can do.
Signora Merighi, Signora Chimenti, and The Francesina (Three Singer lately come from Italy, for the Royal Academy of Musick) had the Honour to sing before her Majesty, the Duke, and Princesses, at Kensington, on Monday Night last, and met with a most gracious Reception, and her Majesty was pleased to approve their several Performances: after which, The Francesina, performed several Dances to the entire Satisfaction of the Court.
And whereas there is a great many Scenes and Machines to be mov’d in this Opera, which cannot be done if Persons should stand upon the Stage (where they could not be without Danger), it is therefore hop’d no Body, even the Subscribers, will take it Ill that they must be deny’d Entrance on the Stage.
Unlike Hoover’s activities, the NSA’s programs come to us with the seal of congressional and judicial approval.
It didn’t take J. Edgar Hoover to engineer this scandal.

Information design is defined as the art and science of preparing information so that it can be used by human beings with efficiency and effectiveness.
Often in passing from district to district have I seen the poor enfeebled labourer, young and old alike, laid down by the side of the bog or road, on which he was employed, too late for kindness to avail, nevertheless, giving his dying blessing to the bestowers of tardy relief.
For the last five years, so many internationals have come to study our problems that I can't even count them anymore, and they have produced tons of reports and recommendations.
In the end, the result was that I lost everything I have built for forty years, while the international community watched from a few hundred meters away.
I don't even have a single photograph left from my life.
And now they tell me to go back and rebuild my life – how can I trust them?
Work expands (so as) to fill the time available for its completion.
Don’t wake it up, call my name, it’s death!
Set them all on a trip of pain, I can’t wait!
pure zeitgeist, a celebration of synth pop's incipient reign with fast beats and even faster singing.
Frogg Café's second CD entitled Creatures is a blend of all of the elements that made prog music great in the days when Yes' Close To Edge, Genesis' Selling England… , Gentle Giant's Free Hand and Zappa's Overnight Sensation, to name a few, were brand new.
However, Frogg are not a cheap rip off, they are a very original band creating something all their own. (...)
Their Zappa/jazz influence is evident in the opening of the tune („Creatures“).
Ultimately, if there's any disappointment to be had with this near-perfect album, it's that it still towers above subsequent efforts as the unequivocal climax of Rage Against the Machine's vision.
Never shall we forget the triumphant cadence with which he concluded Bach’s concerto for three harpsichords, following Moscheles and Thalberg.
He alone knew the style: it was the pedal solo of an organ fugue in double octaves.
What gigantic power he put into these things!
The beauty of the exhibition, and, indeed, of the numerous demonstrations made by Mendelssohn in honour of Bach, was that he announced himself the disciple of a master contemned by ignorance and prejudice.
We don't think the association with the older monuments can be a coincidence — this was a place which was very important to people over an extraordinarily long period of time
Speed-of-light/line-of-sight weapons like the laser on the ABL are fundamentally different from kinetic weapons.
Line-of-sight precision ensures one-shot, one-kill effectiveness.
Speed-of-light response ensures that the target has no warning to make evasive maneuvers or employ countermeasures.
If the technology proves practical and affordable, a DE weapon will provide a near-instant kill of targets detected within its effective range.
Echoes of Giulio Douhet’s combat plane able to clear its way through the skies with superior firepower can be heard as the ABL takes flight.
He was giving voice in a rock ’n’ roll setting to the Oedipus complex, at the time a widely discussed tendency in Freudian psychology.
He wasn’t saying he wanted to do that to his own mom and dad.
He was re-enacting a bit of Greek drama.
It was theatre!
One masque group was known as the ′Société Mattachine’.
These societies, lifelong secret fraternities of unmarried townsmen who never performed in public unmasked, were dedicated to going out into the countryside and conducting dances and rituals during the Feast of Fools, at the Vernal Equinox.
Sometimes these dance rituals, or masques, were peasant protests against oppression — with the maskers, in the people’s name, receiving the brunt of a given lord’s vicious retaliation.
So we took the name Mattachine because we felt that we 1950s Gays were also a masked people, unknown and anonymous, who might become engaged in morale building and helping ourselves and others, through struggle, to move toward total redress and change.

Japanese expansion in the direction of the southwestern Pacific area is declared to be of peaceful nature, American cooperation shall be given in the production and procurement of natural resources (such as oil, rubber, tin, nickel) which Japan needs.
This Scef came in a light boat to an island of the ocean which is called Scani, arms around about him, and he was a very young boy, unknown to the dwellers in the land.
But he was accepted by them and cared for like one of their own kind, and afterwards they chose him as king, from whose family descended King Æthelwulf.
Overall I can't recommend this game.
Fascinating as some of it's ideas are, there's not enough here to justify the purchase for strategy gamers or role-players - unless you really want the free paperback from J. Robert King that comes in the box.
To receive media coverage in motor sport there's only F1, Indianapolis or Le Mans.
The first require resources that we haven't got; the second excites little media interest in Europe contrary to a Le Mans car that we can afford in terms resources.
This was the week that changed the world, as what we have said in that Communique is not nearly as important as what we will do in the years ahead to build a bridge across 16,000 miles and 22 years of hostilities which have divided us in the past.
We use bombs to blow things into pieces, not to make them fly.
There is a spirit got up against the Dominion of Mr. Handel, a subscription carry’d on, and Directors chosen, who have contracted with Senesino, and have sent for Cuzzoni, and Farinelli
At present, the UK uses the “first past the post” system to elect MPs to the House of Commons.
Should the “alternative vote” system be used instead?
I am afraid that this is a one-off project, but I would really, really hope that there is more of this in the future, because it is hilarious, highly original and, well, Bavarian!
I want more!
This year she's been fighting to revamp the $2.5 trillion money-market-fund industry, which she believes remains vulnerable to market panics.
Like any good punk rocker, Bart had the nihilism thing down from the very beginning.
Though not so much pissed off as extremely undisciplined, the Bart Simpson of the Ullman shorts is either fighting with his sister, inciting his father into murderous levels of rage, executing dangerous stunts that end in cartoonish levels of disaster, or simply spitting snarky one-liners at whatever authority figures cross his path.
This appetite for destruction continued to be the defining feature of the smart-assed kid who dominated many episodes of the first few seasons of The Simpsons–the version that spawned Bart-mania–though his methods and motivations show considerably more nuance than the white-trash Bart of the Ullman era.
If it was never revealed that Jimmy was once a frustrated musician I realised that, once this song was written, it didn’t matter.
What matters is that he looked up to his hereos in The Who, young men critically a few years older than he, and felt let down by what they’d become, and what they had allowed to happen to their music.
I quoted my own song ‘My Generation’ as an example of the promise that Jimmy felt had been broken.
The island of Mbenga, five miles south of Viti-levui, is five miles long and three wide; the land rises boldly on all sides towards the interior, terminating in two prominent basaltic peaks thirteen hundred feet above the sea level.
How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries!
Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy.
Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live.
Fabian (in fact meant: Florian La Roche) had previously been in the Debian project, but left due to the fighting.

In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.
We should take nothing for granted.
Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.
And may at last my weary age Find out the peaceful hermitage, The hairy gown and mossy cell Where I may sit and rightly spell Of every star that heav’n doth show, And every herb that sips the dew; Till old experience do attain To something like prophetic strain.
These pleasures, Melancholy, give, And I with thee will choose to live.
I’ve always liked folky, acoustic music, but I’ve never fully explored it.
I turned back time and was listening to Johnny Cash and early Elton John before I wrote Let Me Go.
I’m 42; I don’t want to do urban or dance music.
I love Mumford &amp; Sons—it’s good, English music, but let’s be honest, they got it off Johnny Cash too.
Through my appearance here today...I hope that police officers in the future will not experience...the same frustration and anxiety that I was subjected to...for the past five years at the hands of my superiors...because of my attempt to report corruption.
I was made to feel that I had burdened them with an unwanted task.
The problem is that the atmosphere does not yet exist...in which an honest police officer can act...without fear of ridicule or reprisal from fellow officers.
Police corruption cannot exist unless it is at least tolerated...at higher levels in the department.
Therefore, the most important result that can come from these hearings...is a conviction by police officers that the department will change. In order to ensure this...an independent, permanent investigative body...dealing with police corruption, like this commission, is essential..
This sequel is more twisted, more brutal and more memorable than that first volume, it's solidified Zero Escape as a series, and it's an experience I recommend to every gamer – if you're over 18, and if you've played 999 first.
Virtue’s Last Reward builds an unforgettable story on the dilemma of a choice: Will you ally, or will you betray?
It's an album that I want to do a little bit different.
I don't want it to sound like an extension of Yours Truly.
I want it to sound like an evolution.
I want to explore more sounds and experiment a little bit.

I’d done the «Linda Lee» part and then all of a sudden it was time to do the «Supergirl» thing.
So I said, well, give me a second.
I went out into the aisle and I started changing and I caught myself in the mirror.
And there I was in this leotard and this old Danskin skirt, you know, and I’m thinking, Jesus, I look like a jackass.
I say there’s no way I can go in there now.
We were hanging by our eyelids!
Australia and India were threatened by the Japanese, we had temporarily lost control of the Indian Ocean, the Germans were threatening Iran and our oil, Auchinleck was in precarious straits in the desert, and the submarine sinkings were heavy.
It is a witty and clever achievement but Spink and his superb collaborators have gone one better. They have imbued Tragedy with the quality that made Ashton irresistible – his charm.
The two opera houses are, neither of them, in a successful way; and it is the confirmed opinion that this winter will compleat your friend Handel’s destruction, as far as the loss of his money can destroy him.
Just as Israel Regardie rescued the Golden Dawn from oblivion, so have the Ciceros, with their unrivaled grasp of magical practice, maintained it as a living tradition made available to all ...
They are indeed true magicians of the Golden Dawn.
The photograph is most telling, and as a slide will rouse any audience to an outburst of rage, the expression on the father’s face the horror of the by-standers the mute appeal of the hand and foot will speak to the most skeptical.
I once smelled a bad smell in my room, and when looking into my PC I found a dead mouse skeleton in it.
From that moment on, my friends called me "dead mouse".
But in IRC your nickname can only be eight digits long, so I called myself "deadmau5", while the 5 means a S. And I just kept it.

came as a complete and very unpleasant surprise It put 'paid' to the question of immediate exploitation.
I think I was reading the Bible around that time.
That’s where I think phrases such as ‘workman’s wages’ came from, and ‘seeking out the poorer quarters’.
That was biblical.
It is not possible in the short time available to do justice to flood of papers with which Michael Fisher has been associated.
Some of these have initiated new areas of research; for example the exact susceptibility of the two-dimensional Ising model, correlation in the three-dimensional Ising model and critical scattering, renormalization of critical exponents resulting from hidden variables, finite size scaling, the droplet model, partial differential approximants. the ANNNI model, Others, review articles, have become classics to which successive generations of graduate students and other researchers in the field have turned for guidance; for example the Boulder lectures on critical phenomena, the 1964 Journal of Mathematical Physics review of correlation in fluids and magnets, the oft-quoted 1967 review in Reports on Progress in Physics, and the 1973 Reviews of Modern Physics review of renormalization group.
Each and every of one of his papers contains new information of significance, and his collaborators will all verify that nothing is allowed to appear in print without Michael Fisher personally assuring himself that it measures up to his high standards.
Well, I'd have to say that Six Degrees was probably the most important time for me.
That period was one of the best times of my life.
I have for some time been thinking that it would be a good thing if there were a challenge cup which should be held from year to year by the champion hockey team in the Dominion (of Canada).
There does not appear to be any such outward sign of a championship at present, and considering the general interest which matches now elicit, and the importance of having the game played fairly and under rules generally recognized, I am willing to give a cup which shall be held from year to year by the winning team.
God has permitted me to suffer this shameful doom as punishment for having contributed to my husband’s death.
I falsely accused him of loving in an incestuous manner, his sister, Queen Anne Boleyn.

Drinking, in every culture, is a rule-governed activity, hedged about with prescriptions and norms concerning who may drink how much of what, when, where, with whom, in what manner and with what effects.
I remember stopping some place where I bought two books on Mengele.

Too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things.
Our Gross National Product, now, is over $800 billion dollars a year, but that Gross National Product – if we judge the United States of America by that – that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage.
It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them.
It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl.
It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities.
It counts Whitman’s rifle and Speck’s knife.
And the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children.
Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play.
It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials.
It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.
And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.
The classes in a package should be closed together against the same kinds of changes.
A change that affects a package affects all the classes in that package.
Ever since those beginnings in 1977, the TeX research project that I embarked on was driven by two major goals.
The first goal was quality: we wanted to produce documents that were not just nice, but actually the best. The second major goal was archival: to create systems that would be independent of changes in printing technology as much as possible.
When the next generation of printing devices came along, I wanted to be able to retain the same quality already achieved, instead of having to solve all the problems anew.
I wanted to design something that would be still usable in 100 years.
"The Nobody" is a quality work from a creator with a unique voice, and its haunting mystery lingers long after you close the book.
Union Justice and Confidence
Peter Travers is astonished by Elizabeth Olsen's performance in Martha Marcy May Marlene, a new drama about a young woman who escapes a nightmarish cult.
Olsen, the younger sister of Mary Kate and Ashley, is utterly captivating in this film – it's almost impossible to take your eyes off her when she's on screen.
fine in terms of vocal attack and material touches on the excellent in terms of instrumental support.
I looked up and saw a Marine with what they call the thousand-yard stare, and I lifted my Leica and snapped his picture.
The soldier’s gaze never left my lens.
He was essentially an individualist, with only a few really intimate friends.
It was with sadness that I learned of the death of former President Nelson Mandela, and I send prayerful condolences to all the Mandela family, to the members of the government, and to all the people of South Africa, in commending the soul of the deceased to the mercy of Almighty God, I ask the Lord to console and strengthen all who mourn his loss.
Thrones is unsentimental and often brutal.

Long years ago, at the very beginning of my writing career, I attacked Nietzsche and his super-man idea.
This was in The Sea Wolf.
Lots of people read The Sea Wolf, no one discovered that it was an attack upon the super-man philosophy
No woman should ever run for president.
She's have to admit she was over 35.
A romantic, elegant and important album in bringing Brazilian music to a wider audience.
I know my fans look up to me and that's why I make my songs so personal; it's all about things I've experienced and things I like or hate.
I write for myself and hope that my fans like what I have to say.
Okay, so the hero’s name is stupid and the plot sounds like a rehash of Stargate, but trust us, this action-adventure game was revolutionary.
You could freely explore open world cities, mountains and forests (two years before GTA III).
You could commandeer extraterrestrial vehicles – in this case, dinosaur-like creatures - for quicker transport (two years before Halo).
You could pick and choose missions in the order that suited your playing style (nine years before Fallout 3).
The convent built by Pugin also at the expense of £4,000 is a very poor inconvenient building, as ugly and as irregular outside as anything ever I saw.
The architect says it is in the old style of English buildings, but I cannot conceive what recommendation that is, when other houses are built much more conveniently and more imposing in appearance.
Yes sir, we are legal, we are, though we’re not as legal as you. / No sir, we’re not equal, no, though we’re both from the EU.
Every cut on this clear, consistent, elusive album affords distinct present pleasure.
Admittedly, when they're over they're over— you don't flash on them the way you do on Cindy Tells Me and Baby's on Fire.
But that's just his way of being modest.
A collaboration between an avant-garde modern classical composer and a traditional Indian/Hindi composer/performer seems as unlikely as ice hockey on the River Styx.
However, Passages is a collaboration between Philip Glass and Ravi Shankar and it works quite well.
Shankar’s smooth style fits nicely with Glass’ dissonant orchestrations.
Tired of being reminded by other magazines that the best albums in the world were made by The Beatles, Beach Boys and Rolling Stones?
So are we.
Over the next 18 pages, we poll our writers to come up with a guide to 100 records that should have ignited the world’s imagination, except that everyone else was fiddling…
It was a time of 'super-groups', of furiously hyped bands who could barely cut it, and Led Zeppelin initially found themselves fighting upstream to prove their authenticity

Frankly, my witnesses are prostitutes, madams, heels, pimps and ex-convicts… .I wish to call to your attention that these are the only witnesses we could possibly have brought here.
We can't get Bishops to testify in a case involving prostitution.
And this combination was not run under the arch lights of Madison Square Garden.
We have to use the testimony of bad men to convict other bad men.
It has been a mystery ever since it was discovered more than fifty years ago, and all good theoretical physicists put this number up on their wall and worry about it.
and those handsome Moors all in white and turbens like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows or the posadas glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent
The season opener of The Simpsons’ fourth season has lost none of its freshness, wit or boldness over the years.
It’s timeless in the best possible sense, 22 minutes of hilarious anarchy that more than stands the test of time. ‘Kamp Krusty’ would seem to set the bar prohibitively high but a mere glance at the episodes to come—‘A Streetcar Named Marge,’ ‘Homer The Heretic,’ and ‘Lisa The Beauty Queen’ are the next three episodes—suggests otherwise.
God bless you, The Simpsons.
You were truly doing God’s work.
Overall, though, with the mouse interface, multiple screens, good graphics, and modem play, 688 Attack Sub can be viewed as a milestone in subsim development.
I thought what a fantastic insane thing to say.
A warm gun means, you’ve just shot something.
Actually, I didn’t kill more than four or five people in hand-to hand combat … We’d face an enemy trench that we’d captured, and when we called out, ‘Ni, Lai-Lai!’ (You, come on!), the Chinese soldiers were so stupid, they’d rush toward us all at once.
Then we’d line them up and cut them down, from one end of the line to the other.
I was told that I did not learn respect at school.
I learned one thing: I learned about self-respect and self-regard for Australia — not about some cultural cringe to a country which decided not to defend the Malayan peninsula, not to worry about Singapore and not to give us our troops back to keep ourselves free from Japanese domination.
This was the country that you people wedded yourself to, and even as it walked out on you and joined the Common Market, you were still looking for your MBEs and your knighthoods, and all the rest of the regalia that comes with it.
The question of culture has the capacity to annoy anyone seriously interested in the topic
So the way we see it is someone would pick up Super Mario 3D Land and play that, and then maybe they would move onto Super Mario Galaxy or Super Mario Sunshine or Super Mario 64 after that.
I’m not interested in the massive heroic tunes anymore.
Now, I’m interested in how I can take two, three, or four notes and make a really complex emotional structure.

We're either going to have to improve the quality of what we're doing in the Pro Bowl or consider other changes or even considering eliminating the game if that's the kind of quality game we're going to provide.
The lyrics were just gathering thoughts.
Like ‘I go back so far, I’m in front of me’ – I don’t know where that came from, but if I’d been writing with John he would have gone ‘OK, leave that one in; we don’t know what it means but we do know what it means.’
I’m a huge fan of his.
About two years ago, I was at Sundance and saw his latest film Tokyo biyori.
It totally inspired me to go out to make the cyberpunk movie in America.
No one has done the cyberpunk genre over here.
When I finished This Is England, I had a wealth of material and unused ideas that I felt very keen to take further – audiences seemed to really respond to the characters we created and out of my longstanding relationship with Film4 and Channel 4 the idea for a television serial developed.
Not only did I want to take the story of the gang broader and deeper, I also saw in the experiences of the young in 1986 many resonances to now – recession, lack of jobs, sense of the world at a turning point.
Whereas the film told part of the story, the TV serial will tell the rest.
I have called a narrator reliable when he speaks for or acts in accordance with the norms of the work (which is to say the implied author’s norms), unreliable when he does not.
It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you.
I've been number two in films for donkey's years.
my life and tenure in public office are an open book. I have always tried to do my best in serving this great nation of ours.
In the last ten years, we as a country have seen many successes and achievements that we should be proud of.
Today, India is a far stronger country in every respect than it was a decade ago.
As I leave office, my abiding memory will be the love and kindness that I have always received from you.
I owe everything to this country, this great land of ours where I, an underprivileged child of Partition, was empowered enough to rise and occupy high office.
I firmly believe that the emergence of India as a major powerhouse of the evolving global economy is an idea whose time has come.
Friedman's research became critical in the literature of oceanography and physiology, among other fields and applications.
For example, in order to make accurate forecasts of weather, you need an accurate model of the medium.
Harold Friedman helped us to model, explain and better understand the actions of electrolytes.
We only create a New Super Mario Bros. title one per platform.
I think we’ll probably go ahead and continue at that pace.
That being said, that’s probably Miyamoto’s choice, so I can’t give you a 100 per cent guarantee that that’s the pace we’ll continue at.
A great feudal oppressor, who, riding on some cruel purpose through the forest of Guiyock, was thrown from his horse, and his foot being caught in the stirrup, was dragged along by the frightened animal till he was torn to pieces.
The expression, “Walter of Guiyock’s curse,” is proverbial.
Maternal deaths are both caused by poverty and are a cause of it.
The costs of childbirth can quickly exhaust a family’s income, bringing with it even more financial hardship.
When Outcast came along in 1998, it was a revelation to the gamers of the time.
It was one of the first games to feature a fully blown, fully realized orchestral score, it’s even today oftentimes heralded as ‘best game music ever’ by many people just because it was the first time they heard a game using a musical language that used to be confined to movies before.
Any living organism’s basic options: adapt, migrate or die.
If you're adamant that Ireland may sink with another singer-songwriter on tour, then this is a record to seek out; you won't notice the time passing and the nation will remain afloat.

I always had material, but some people that I worked with didn’t really care, because they wanted to write the stuff.
(iii) that within this area the title to all islands, islets, reefs, banks and shoals, if situated on the northern side of the said red line, is vested in the Republic of Argentina; and if situated on the southern, in the Republic of Chile;
Why should a man be scorned if, finding himself in prison, he tries to get out and go home?
Or if, when he cannot do so, he thinks and talks about other topics than jailers and prison-walls?
It was a known fact among the criminal underworld that dealing with Al Malnik was the same as dealing with Meyer Lansky...
We are credibly inform’d that one Day last Week Mr. H–d–l, Director-General of the Opera-House, sent a Message to Signior Senesino, the famous Italian Singer, acquainting Him that He had no farther Occasion for his Service; and that Senesino reply’d the next Day by a Letter, containing a full Resignation of all his Parts in the Opera, which He had perform’d for many Years with great Applause.
I began to run with the crowd, and as we approached the bridge I could see an incomplete barricade of crowd control barriers, and a handful of police, KPS and UNMIK.
As the crowd came onto the bridge these police tried to stop them from crossing but were totally outnumbered, I then noticed that there was nothing behind this handful of police to stop the crowd.
It would be usual in these situations in Mitrovica to have KFOR troops blocking the bridge, but on that day there was not a single soldier on the bridge.
The Albanian demonstrators seemed as surprised as I was and many of them faltered halfway across and seemed pretty unsure what to do, but the ringleaders were shouting them forward, so they went on to the Serb side.
My chief joy comes from learning that the Silmarillion is not rejected with scorn.
I have suffered a sense of fear and bereavement, quite ridiculous, since I let this private and beloved nonsense out; and I think if it had seemed to you to be nonsense I should have felt really crushed.
But I shall certainly now hope one day to be able, or to be able to afford, to publish the Silmarillion!
I think it is plain that quite apart from it, a sequel or successor to The Hobbit is called for.
But I am sure you will sympathize when I say that the construction of elaborate and consistent mythology (and two languages) rather occupies the mind, and the Silmarils are in my heart.
Mr Baggins began as a comic tale among conventional and inconsistent Grimm’s fairy-tale dwarves, and got drawn into the edge of it – so that even Sauron the terrible peeped over the edge.
And what more can hobbits do?
They can be comic, but their comedy is suburban unless it is set against things more elemental.
But the real fun about orcs and dragons (to my mind) was before their time.
She’s a bit of a trendsetter – she does loads of different things on a major scale.
You’d expect her to use an American rapper , but she chose me.
It meant a lot.
I’d like to be in that Spanish market.
I got into the whole reggaeton thing when it came out, so I always wanted to get around to something like that.
Elmer was a very slight man about 5 feet 10 inches tall who wore thick heavy glasses and couldn't see well even with those.
One time, he was up at Crater Lake.
They always wanted him to have somebody to go with him.
He told me, ‘I don't want anybody with me.
They hold me back.’ Well one day he went alone and got down in Annie Creek Canyon and he got into a hornet's nest.
He knocked off his glasses and they fell down into the water, clear down the mountain.
He was there all night. He couldn't find his way out.
Then they told him he had to have someone with him. They wouldn't let him go alone after that.
Elmer, who was in his sixties at the time, said ‘They just hold me back.
I don't like to work with them.’
Edgy, violent, moving, agreeably complex, darkly funny, fast-paced, nudity-embracing and possessed of an army of compelling characters, HBO’s “Game of Thrones” is an A+ entertainment and the season’s best new series.
I wager it may even end “Mad Men’s” long reign as Emmy’s best drama.
Or rather shall we find in the new Cathedral of Armagh, designed and almost erected by poor Duff, but since consigned to other hands, which have contrived in its completion with mournful success, to totally invert the order of architectural chronology, placing in juxta position the most jarring and incongruous features, and with a ruthless “eclecticism” for ever obliterating all graces of the harmony and fitness imparted to the original design by its unfortunate author?
In the end, that is what makes the Barbican exhibition important: it brings together the raw materials needed by anyone who wants to develop an aesthetic for a new genre.
But if you are a gamer who doesn't care two hoots about the cultural implications, it still looks like a terrific day out.
What luck some people have.
Nobody will ever come to attack me in such a place.
If you see me walking down the street or in the pages of your magazine… They saying I’m looking like a lady.
They saying that love is going to change me.”
It was just two guys pouting and being silly.
We had our solo albums to bring out and I said ‘Mine’s ready and I want to bring it out.’
Paul wasn’t quite ready – but he had a calendar with the date (I’ve forgotten the day now) marked in yellow saying, ‘That’s my day – I’m bringing my record out then.’
I don't think there are ever many fine days on this forlorn island...

A Bill for an act introducing a new mathematical truth and offered as a contribution to education to be used only by the State of Indiana free of cost by paying any royalties whatever on the same, provided it is accepted and adopted by the official action of the Legislature of 1897.

We haven’t evaluated the new recommendation for PNG, and it remains to be seen whether the new version will have an effect on the use of GIF images.
If so, the patent situation will have achieved its purpose, which is to advance technological innovation.
So we applaud that.

Getting the most out of Lost Odyssey will require a bit of patience, even from those used to the slower pace of the genre.
What you believe to be true is false.
What you thought right, wrong.
who but the supreme and perfect artist could have got from a mere colour a motive so full of marvel: and now I am half enamoured of the paper that touched his hand, and the ink that did his bidding, grown fond of the sweet comeliness of his charactery, for since my childhood I have loved none better than your marvellous kinsman, that godlike boy, the real Adonis of our age In my heaven he walks eternally with Shakespeare and the Greeks.
It’s much like in the Bible where they’re worshipping the golden Ox and Moses comes down and he’s pissed.
That’s what I’ve felt like over the last 30 years sometimes.
People worshipping somebody for doing something they do naturally anyways.
What the fuck’s that about?
So I poke fun at that.
There’s a lot of sarcasm on this album.
Quechup was one of the first social networking sites to include such a feature back in 2005.
With its growing popularity (social networks), expectations of what features a service should have and how they should work have emerged.
Quechup's address check did not conform to what users now expect as the norm
Rajeev Menon's new film assumes and presents itself as being utterly self-confident of its content and screenplay, so much so that we can feel the film ripping apart at its seams, about a half an hour into its initial narration.
Yet Kandukondain seems to have its audience in its grip for a reason or two: impeccable acting by Mammooty, Tabu & Ajeethkumar (in portions), a true to the heart climax and A.R.Rahman working long hours to perfect some tunes which will stay in memory, at least for a short while.
Foreigners are assholes; foreigners are scum; I don't like 'em; I don't want 'em in this country; I don't want 'em selling me doughnuts; I don't want 'em pumping my gas; I don't want 'em downwind of my life – OK?
So anyhow – and I'm dead serious.
When you’re playing and you’re just you, powerful things happen.

He's no more insane than I am.
There's nothing of the mad about Guiteau: he's a cool, calculating blackguard, a polished ruffian, who has gradually prepared himself to pose in this way before the world.
He was a deadbeat, pure and simple.
Finally, he got tired of the monotony of deadbeating. He wanted excitement of some other kind and notoriety, and he got it..
Vagif's music is from another planet! It's the music of the future!

„there are no peer reviewed articles by anyone advocating for intelligent design supported by pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system occurred.“
In the building, each separate portion of the building devoted to a special purpose asserts itself as an individual factor in the whole. The completed whole crowns the end of a high ridge in Hollywood.
KFOR was on top of the job
Despite the three cover tunes and the large number of comparisons the music brings to mind, Licence to Funk is neither a full retro album nor a slavish imitation of all those acts -- the Funk Unit is in top form, with tightly locked grooves and inspired soloing, and the record is an excellent showcase for a band that knows how to use a funk rhythm as a springboard to exciting interplay.
While all of the musicians are great , Ray Parker, Jr.'s presence is what gives the group that something extra: listening to his opening guitar licks on Freak U and the bluesy Secret alone makes you glad he's back.
Bunny came from the Haymarket Opera, and supped with me comfortably.
They have Farinelli, Merighi, with no sound in her voice, but thundering action – a beauty with no other merit; and one Chimenti, a tolerable good woman with a pretty voice and Montagnana, who roars as usuall With this band of singers and dull Italian operas, such as you almost fall asleep at, they presume to rival Handel – who has Strada, that sings better than ever she did; Gizziello, who is much improved since last year; and Annibali who has the best part of Senesino’s voice und Caristini’s, with a prodigious fine taste and good actionl Mr. Handel has two new operas ready – Erminius and Justino.
He was here two or three mornings ago and played to me both the overtures, which are charming.
‘Penny royal tea is a herbal abortive,’ he says. ‘I threw that in because I have so many friends who have tried to use that, and it never worked.
The song is about a person who’s beyond depressed; they’re in their death bed, pretty much.’ Cobain’s own bout with serious stomach pain was well documented last year.
‘Yeah, it did rub off on the song,’ he admits. And I couldn’t help noticing the ‘Canadian’ reference to a Leonard Cohen afterworld.
‘That was my therapy, when I was depressed and sick. I’d read things like Malloy Dies by Beckett, or listen to Leonard Cohen, which would actually make it worse,’ he laughs.
The plot risks bursting under the strain of its coincidences.
Gentlemen.
Everything is lost.
I do not believe Canadians will manage to help us.
We have only 110 men left, with 50 rounds per gun and 5 rounds per tank… Fight to the end!
To surrender to the SS is senseless, you know it well.
Gentlemen!
Good luck – tonight, we will die for Poland and civilization.
We will fight to the last platoon, to the last tank, then to the last man.
I can’t listen to it now without getting all dewy-eyed.
And if I play it on the radio, I have to segue it into the front of another record because I can’t speak after I’ve heard it.
...he wouldn’t have left something like that sit there in the day room with his name tacket on it for twenty or theirty years so the Big Nure could use it as an example of what can happen if you buck the system
Sir At my arrival in Town from the Country, I found my self hon̄ored of your kind invitation.

I hope, at your return to Town, Sir, I shall make up this Loss
The archetypal Stray Cats song, 1982's Stray Cat Strut is, ironically, not a rockabilly tune at all, but a jazzy R&B-style ballad… Built on a killer walking bass line and Brian Setzer's tremolo-enhanced guitar lines, "Stray Cat Strut" has a timeless quality… ., and Setzer's slyly self-inflating lyrics are delivered with enough humor and panache to keep it from merely sounding arrogant.
though the first act of this opera is rather feeble, and the last not so excellent as that of some of his other dramas, the second act contains beauties of various kinds sufficient to establish its reputation, as a work worthy of its great author in his meridian splendor.

The most stunning thing about the track, of course, is Bonzo's amazing kick drum.
It's superhuman when you realize he was not playing with double kick.
That's one kick drum!
That's when people started understanding what he was all about.
As a concerned American citizen, I apologize to President Bush because my remark was disrespectful.
I feel that whoever holds that office should be treated with the utmost respect.
We are currently in Europe and witnessing a huge anti-American sentiment as a result of the perceived rush to war.
While war may remain a viable option, as a mother, I just want to see every possible alternative exhausted before children and American soldiers' lives are lost.
I love my country.
I am a proud American.
That slave is the small, composite group of anointed brothers serving at world headquarters during Christ’s presence who are directly involved in preparing and dispensing spiritual food.

They all deserve the award – sure my mother even told me that Mick Flannery was going to win, she said you're good, Ritchie , but he's gorgeous.
My father was very gentle, never one to spank or scold.

in particular by mixed factors of appurtenance, coastal configuration, equidistance, and also of convenience, navigability, and the desirability of enabling each Party so far as possible to navigate in its own waters.
Because of their age-long training in human relations — for that is what feminine intuition really is — women have a special contribution to make to any group enterprise.
Here’s the smell of the blood still: All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
If the morphological and lexical accord which I find on every hand between Nadene and Indo-Chinese is accidential, then every analogy on God's earth is an accident.
The purpose of Marine City is neither intended to enlarge the land nor to escape from the land.
The existing confusion of land cities should not be brought to Marine City.
The leave-it-alone liquidationists headed by Secretary of the Treasury Mellon … felt that government must keep its hands off and let the slump liquidate itself.
Mr. Mellon had only one formula: ‘Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate’ … ‘It will purge the rottenness out of the system.

People will work harder, live a more moral life.
Values will be adjusted, and enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people.’
I was almost shot in a gun attack at Norfolk Street.
I came away wanting a gun. It was survival.
You wanted to protect your own people … my family and myself.
When the barricades went up I wanted a gun so I approached this fella who was in the IRA and asked for gun and he said: could I shoot a British soldier?
At that time I hadn't the idea that it was the British government's fault.
was designed as an exercise in exploring how far a stream cipher can be simplified without sacrificing its security, speed or flexibility.
While simple designs are more likely to be vulnerable to simple, and possibly devastating, attacks (which is why we strongly discourage the use of Trivium at this stage), they certainly inspire more confidence than complex schemes, if they survive a long period of public scrutiny despite their simplicity.
I also wrote this song about a young boy wanting to be like his mentor.
And it was me wanting to be like him .
The Nicaraguan case is absolutely unique in history. We’ve been able to see how it is that children — not adults — generate language, and we have been able to record it happening in great scientific detail.
And it’s the first and only time that we’ve actually seen a language being created out of thin air.
We writers are not babies, who must be shielded from the world, we are men and women, and we must act like men and women!

It seems, however, that one gentleman (Mr. M‘Carthy) has, in two instances at least, succeeded in designing churches for that communion which imitate ancient models.
The one, the church of S. Kevin, at Glendalough, is in First-Pointed, consisting of a nave and chancel.
The other, that of S. Skyre, at Kilskyre, is of a more elaborate design, and in Middle-Pointed.
We do not like the cinqfoiling of the lights of the eastern windows, nor the trefoil in the head of the east window.
The quatrefoil opening also above is not felicitous.
Still, however, the designs show promise.

It's basically a dream, because of course this is not reality I can't afford a mansion right now, so it's like I fall asleep and I dream about doing a duet with Wanya and I'm in this big mansion wearing these grown clothes, big beautiful Whitney Houston-type clothes.
Pumped with fluid, inside your brain / Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes / Burning flesh, drips away / Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil / Frigid cold, cracks your limbs / How long can you last / In this frozen water burial? / Sewn together, joining heads / Just a matter of time / til you rip yourselves apart

Last Night their Majesties were at the Theatre Royal in Covent-Garden, to see the Opera of Orestes, which was perform’d with great Applause.
I just felt it would be easier to be a machine, so you didn’t have to bother with those emotional things.
I felt I was divorced from any particular generation, or any particular way of living.
It is disconcerting to find eighteenth-century opinion, particularly when it is expressed by two men who were acquainted with Handel, so different from our own.
Perhaps it should be taken as fair warning against passing judgment on opera from the printed page, although Burney’s description of Orlando shows that he at least consulted the manuscript, not merely the Walsh edition.
The same opera, to modem eyes after the experience of twentieth-century revivals, is ‘one of Handel’s richest and most rewarding operas’ (Andrew Porter, The New Yorker, 14 March 1983) and to Winton Dean a ‘masterpiece musically the richest of all his operas’ (Handel and the Opera Seria, p.
91), comparable on several counts with The Magic Flute. It was chiefly their concentration on set pieces that makes the commentaries of both Burney and Hawkins on Handel’s later operas defective.
Opera seria originated in the word-book, and a study of this reveals levels of the composer’s creative intentions which escaped them: the ‘Argument’, the allocation of arioso and accompanied recitative in place of secco (for an increase in intensity that did not imply an obligatory exit for the character), the introduction of sinfonie and above all, the consistent development of a psychological thread and the exploitation (rather than simply the creation) of situations.
To prepare selected military, civilian, and international leaders for the responsibilities of strategic leadership; educate current and future leaders on the development and employment of landpower in a joint, multinational and interagency environment; conduct research and publish on national security and military strategy; and engage in activities in support of the Army’s strategic communication efforts.
The truth is, that this kind of entertainment being so entirely sensual, it had no possibility of getting the better of our reason but by its novelty; and that novelty could never be supported but by an annual change of the best voices, which like the finest flowers bloom but for a season, and when that is over, are only dead nose-gays.
We call upon all our people to gather in halls, churches, mosques, temples, synagogues and in their homes for prayer services and meditation, reflecting on the life of Madiba and his contribution to our country and the world.

The director wanted all movements in slow motion so I had to lip sync the vocals in double speed.
My first lesson in how to sing an emotional ballad Mickey Mouse style.
A strange way to make a living.
The world is a comedy to those that think, a tragedy to those that feel.
After I was entered within the outward gate, I was shewed his stables, where I saw very fair and goodly horses, both for war and other uses, amongst the rest there was one naturally spotted like a leopard or panther, and is called by the name of leopard, a stately courageous beast and so formed as if nature had laid all her cunning aside; only to compose that horse, and indeed I must acknowledge he was made for the service of some great Prince, and not for any inferior person.
The company has never been constrained either by custom or its customers.
My work tends to be quite emotional and concerns itself with the phenomenon of existence.
I am interested in asking who are we and why are we here, both in in life and in the theater.
I am fascinated by the body's ability to move between the mundane and the transcendent.
I am interested in how the presence of the audience creates a space of attention and extraordinary perception.
A troop of lone-tein (riot police comprised of paid thugs) protected by the military trucks, raided the monastery with 200 studying monks.
They systematically ordered all the monks to line up and banged and crushed each one's head against the brick wall of the monastery.
One by one, the peaceful, non resisting monks, fell to the ground, screaming in pain.
Then, they tore off the red robes and threw them all in the military trucks (like rice bags) and took the bodies away.
The head monk of the monastery, was tied up in the middle of the monastery, tortured , bludgeoned, and later died the same day, today.
Tens of thousands of people gathered outside the monastery, warded off by troops with bayoneted rifles, unable to help their helpless monks being slaughtered inside the monastery.
Their every try to forge ahead was met with the bayonets.When all is done, only 10 out of 200 remained alive, hiding in the monastery.
Blood stained everywhere on the walls and floors of the monastery.
I cannot bring myself to listen to the Phil Spector version of the album – I heard a few bars of it once, and was totally disgusted, and think it’s an absolute load of garbage.
As ever, those who pined for the approach of Byrd's '60s dates would tune out a sublime set of material, but maybe some of those who sniffed at the straightforward nature of some of the rhythms and riffing were won over by the supreme layering of the many components … , not to mention some deeply evocative playing from Byrd himself.
Heat produced by pressure expands to fill the mind available, from which it can pass only to a cooler mind.

These are just minor gripes, though, and they do very little to diminish the fine game in front of me.
This is a well-designed board game that's been converted with care, and so long as you're not resting your hopes entirely on playing against the mean old AI, any fan of strategy or board games would do well to give Lords of Waterdeep a look.
Existence, besides being a miracle, is a symbol.
Albeit here for inscrutable purposes the spirit is only to be discerned as it were in a distorting-glass.
On its uncompromising second release, Disco Volante, the group focuses its sound a bit more than on its 1991 self-titled debut but still keeps things unruly and completely unpredictable.
What they’ve created in the process is a totally original and new musical style and an album that sounds like nothing that currently exists.
the Committee is of the view that its assistance in certain cases may most effectively be limited to messages of its concern, including the message sent by inscription of a property on the List of World Heritage in Danger and that such assistance may be requested by any Committee member or the Secretariat.
Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
Even though Ahmad Jamal can sometimes rely a bit too heavily on song quotes, jazz piano fans will enjoy this release.
Much of the Wonderlandish magic found on Eno’s first LP is lost on this rocky terrain, being replaced by a dull, repetitive aura that is annoying as all hell.
If I can't feel it, then I won't sing it And many of the songs I heard were not 'me'.
I'm not the little girl I was when I made my first record.
My voice is a strong instrument now; my vocals come from both my heart and my diaphragm.
My heart because I matured in the four years since the last album; I'm more emotionally there.
Well look in the mirror and what do you see / An American, Russian, a soldier or me? / When you’ve all pressed the buttons just where will you be / When we all fall down?
The name was mine, it means in Latin – ‚ultra‘ means‚ beyond all reasonable expectations‘ and ‚vox‘ means voice, of course.
Conquest lumps together the revisionists, labeling them as Stalinists, semi-Stalinists, and those who lack the mind to understand the enormity of Stalin's criminality.
For the rights of the state, no one has a higher regard and respect than myself, none would go farther to maintain them: It is only by maintaining them faithfully that the Union can be preserved.
But how I ask is this to be effected?
Certainly not by conceding to one state authority to declare an act of Congress void far from it, there is a better remedy .
If Congress, and the Executive, feeling power, and forgetting right, shall overleap the powers the Constituion bestow, the remedy is with the people thro the more peaceful and reasonable course of submitting the whole matter to them at their elections Such abuses as these cannot be of long duration in our enlightened Country where the people rule.
The pilot represents a polished product that neatly introduces an array of characters and establishes Eastwick as a project with no small measure of potential.
For truth is neither more nor less than that character of a proposition which consists in this, that belief in the proposition would, with sufficient experience and reflection, lead us to such conduct as would tend to satisfy the desires we should then have.
To say that truth means more than this is to say that it has no meaning at all.
We have no information that the same idea has also occurred to other scientists but since all the theoretical data bearing on this problem are published, it is quite conceivable that Germany is, in fact, developing this weapon.
Whether this is the case is difficult to find out, since the plant for the separation of isotopes need not be of such a size as to attract attention.
Information that could be helpful in this respect would be data about the exploitation of the uranium mines under German control (mainly in Czechoslovakia) and about any recent German purchases of uranium abroad.
It is likely that the plant would be controlled by Dr. K. Clusius (Professor of Physical Chemistry in Munich University), the inventor of the best method for separating isotopes, and therefore information as to his whereabouts and status might also give an important clue.
At the same time it is quite possible that nobody in Germany has yet realized that the separation of the uranium isotopes would make the construction of a super-bomb possible.
Hence it is of extreme importance to keep this report secret since any rumour about the connection between uranium separation and a super-bomb may set a German scientist thinking along the right lines.
BUT - when it comes to bands like Crush Evil, we must take serious action.
It’s bad enough to have a couple of society bands, but a CHRISTIAN band is too much.
But don't worry, we have plans.
They will not continue for a very long time.
Contrary to popular belief, I (Al Malnik) never worked for Meyer Lansky.
I knew him, and he was a good friend who I spent a lot of time with, but I never represented him in legal matters.
To me, Meyer was quite the grandfather type.
If you knew him and talked to him, you could never imagine that any of the stories you heard about him had any veracity.
You could never imagine that he was responsible for doing the things people said he did.
He was not a person to give in to rage.
Today I weep for my country.
I have watched the events of recent months with a heavy, heavy heart.
No more is the image of America one of strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper.
The image of America has changed.
Around the globe, our friends mistrust us, our word is disputed, our intentions are questioned.
Instead of reasoning with those with whom we disagree, we demand obedience or threaten recrimination.
The opera is too good for the vile taste of the town: it is condemned never more to appear on the stage after this night.
I long to hear its dying song, poor dear swan.
We are to have some old opera revived, which I am sorry for, it will put people upon making comparisons between these singers and those that performed before, which will be a disadvantage among the ill-judging multitude.
The present opera is disliked because it is too much studied, and they love nothing but minuets and ballads, in short the Beggars’ Opera and ‘Hurlothrumbo’ are only worthy of applause.
My dear boy, you are under a wrong impression.
It is not a race, it is merely a means of getting crews to do long rows.
had the same sort of taste in music as I did.
That's why you'll find on the early LPs we both did a song like "You Shook Me."
It was the type of thing we'd both played in bands.
Someone told me he'd already recorded it after we'd already put it down on the first Zeppelin album.
I thought, "Oh dear, it's going to be identical," but it was nothing like it, fortunately.
I just had no idea he'd done it.
It was on Truth but I first heard it when I was in Miami after we'd recorded our version.
It's a classic example of coming from the same area musically, of having a similar taste.
Branded in pain / Marked criminally insane / Locked away and kept restrained / Disapprobation, but what have I done / I have yet only just begun to take your fuckin’ life.
We’re all asking ourselves what we can do to help right now.
I think bringing smiles to the faces of people with a fun game by the end of this year is something maybe only we can do.
I wanted a name that meant something, a name that was more than a cool expression.
For me, Pain of Salvation has the meaning of balance.
Taking the good with the bad.
It is also a good expression in everyday use, when something does not go the way you planned; "well, that’s just the pain of salvation," to indicate that this is just a slight setback on an otherwise painless journey towards your goal.
Zawinul is still no more than a good bandsman, and Lateef's touches of exotica - such as the oboe solo on Brother John or his fury Roland Kirk-like flute improvisations - are an awkward match for the sunnier disposition of the customary material".
A panda walks into a café.
He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws a gun and proceeds to fire it at the other patrons. ‘Why?’ asks the confused, surviving waiter amidst the carnage, as the panda makes towards the exit.
The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder. ‘Well, I'm a panda’, he says, at the door.
‘Look it up.’ The waiter turns to the relevant entry in the manual and, sure enough, finds an explanation.
Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.’
Men and women have always enjoyed having anal sex, so we’re not sure why there’s been a sudden increase, but it might have something to do with the Internet, which was in its infancy the last time a survey of this magnitude was conducted.
It took a lot of courage for him to befriend me in front of Hitler.
You can melt down all the medals and cups I have and they wouldn't be a plating on the 24-karat friendship I felt for Luz Long at that moment.
Hitler must have gone crazy watching us embrace.
The sad part of the story is I never saw Long again.
He was killed in World War II.
Not that dignity was ever that important to Meat Loaf, but the shallow spectacle of Hang Cool Teddy Bear lacks the absurd joy of his best: you can hear everybody involved working far too hard to achieve next to nothing.
Since 2007 Argentina's government has published inflation figures that almost nobody believes. ...
In 2010 we added a precautionary footnote to our statistical tables.
From this week, we have decided to drop INDEC's figures entirely.
We are tired of being an unwilling party to what appears to be a deliberate attempt to deceive voters and swindle investors.
The discovery in two lactobacilli of a fatty acid containing 19 carbon atoms raises some rather fundamental points and is in marked contrast to the accepted concept that the fatty acids of animal and plant tissues are mainly of the even carbon chain variety.

We had really long toilet queues, where it was often women who stood and waited.
This meant that many girls ended up using the fence to urinate.
We wish to state that ‘Transilvanian Hunger’ is beyond criticism, and any man who attempts to do so should be thoroughly patronised for his obviously jewish behaviour.
to decide, to the extent that they relate to the region referred to in paragraph (4) of this Article, the questions referred to in her Notes of 11th December 1967 to Her Britannic Majesty's Government and to the Government of the Argentine Republic and to declare that Picton, Lennox and Nueva Islands, the adjacent islands and islets, as well as the other islands and islets whose entire land surface is situated wholly within the region referred to in paragraph (4) of this Article, belong to the Republic of Chile.
It’s entirely possible that these people and their problems will become more interesting as the series goes along, but you can’t tell from the pilot; at this point they’re still constructs more than real characters.
Many journalists have fallen for the conspiracy theory of government.
I do assure you that they would produce more accurate work if they adhered to the cock-up theory.

The struggle continues and will continue until the British are out of Ireland.
I always felt myself to be an unlucky person like Donald, who is a victim of so many circumstances.
But there isn't a person in the United States who couldn't identify with him.
He is everything, he is everybody; he makes the same mistakes that we all make.
He is sometimes a villain, and he is often a real good guy and at all times he is just a blundering person like the average human being, and I think that is one of the reasons people like the duck.
I believe that this tune can be equated with the great classical music around the world.
Well now you go to Germany, you got your Bach, your Beethoven and your Brahms.

If two or more instances in which the phenomenon occurs have only one circumstance in common, while two or more instances in which it does not occur have nothing in common save the absence of that circumstance: the circumstance in which alone the two sets of instances differ, is the effect, or cause, or a necessary part of the cause, of the phenomenon.
The Dusun usually describe himself generically as a tulun tindal (landsman) or, on the West Coast, particularly at Papar, as a Kadazan.
I'd been messing with this song.
It was a bit...what I thought was kind of spacy, you know... a bit kind of Satanic Majesties-like.
And psychedelic in a way... The idea for the song is about this guy who wakes up from a dream and finds himself in another dream

EPCOT...will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of American industry.
It will be a community of tomorrow that will never be completed, but will always be introducing and testing and demonstrating new materials and systems.
And EPCOT will always be a showcase to the world for the ingenuity and imagination of American free enterprise.
"I knew very little about Mandela until I went to an anti-apartheid concert in London in 1983, which gave me the idea for "Nelson Mandela", I never knew how much impact the song would have; it was a hit around the world, and it got back into South Africa and was played at sporting events and ANC rallies-it became an anthem.
atching the movie, it becomes pretty clear that they kept the 1939 classic in mind, thought about what might have happened years before and let their imaginations rip.
That's why the more you like the Judy Garland film, the more you might appreciate "Oz the Great and Powerful."
Appreciate.
Enjoy.
Admire.

I was thinking about the music from cowboy movies.
And I sat down and started playing it, bum-buhdeeda, bum-buhdeeda.
I did that for about an hour.
I got these chords going.
Then I got this melody, it came pretty fast after that.
And the rest was history, right?
No one of the gentlemen who have labored so zealously to extend a knowledge of the natural history of the west within the last ten or twelve years has been more successful than Dr. Kennerly.
Many new species have been first described by himself or from his collections, while his contributions to the biography of American animals have been of the highest interest.
For the reason that he would bring out all those traits of my character I have been trying to conceal from the public for years.
This is not simply a background park, where a series of individual objects exist in a field.
The objects here have become the field.
It is densely packed like the city itself.
This is a different idea of an exterior experience than in most parks.
It is closer to a theme park or a shopping mall.
The demands from Moreno were daily.
He challegend our data, our methodology and our results.
Phone calls from Moreno were 40-minutes-long shouting demands, asking for information to which, by law, neither he nor his office had any right.
There was no stopping his bullying; even the Minister Economics, who outranked Moreno, was cowed into serving as the go-between between Moreno and INDEC.
Coaches plied from Westminster to the Temple, and from several other stairs too and fro, as in the streets, sleds, sliding with skates, bull-baiting, horse and coach races, puppet plays and interludes, cooks, tippling and other lewd places, so that it seemed to be a bacchanalian triumph, or carnival on the water.
Everything that has happened here has shown the world his real face.
For him it is much more important to win the championship than it is for me.

No term of denunciation would be too strong to apply to these responsible for the insane and criminal rising of last week.
A whimsical, trippy ode, these days it sounds like a psychedelic Spinal Tap song, with words describing blue trees and flowers… .Interestingly, the bridge section is one of the hardest-rocking efforts by the Rolling Stones from this period.
If I had had the power and the management entirely in my hands, I believe I could have healed that old sore, and established peace and amity with Joseph’s Indians.
It could only have been done, first, by a retrocession of Wallowa (already belonging to Oregon) to the United States, and then setting that country apart for ever for the Indians ; and, second, by the removal therefrom of every white settler, making to each a proper renumeration for his land and improvements.
But this power I did not have

I have very hurt feelings about Brannon.
What happened between he and I is just between he and I. It was a breakdown of trust.
I would have quit any show where I was not allowed to participate in the process like that.
I wasn’t allowed to participate in the process, and I wasn’t part of the show.
I felt like I was freelancing my own show. … I was very disappointed that my long-time friend and writing partner acted in that manner, that crossed lines to the point where I felt like I had to walk away from Star Trek, which was something that meant a lot to me for a very long time, from my childhood right through my entire professional career.
The surprised and pleased club women saw a small pine box standing on the floor.
There were some wheels and belts near the box, and a workman who had them in charge.
In the top of the box was a hole perhaps an inch in diameter.
As they looked through this hole they saw the picture of a man.
It was a most marvellous picture.
It bowed and smiled and waved its hands and took off its hat with the most perfect naturalness and grace.
Every motion was perfect.
There was not a hitch or a jerk.
No wonder Edison chuckled at the effect he produced with his Kinetograph.
It emerged out of a stick-shaped geometer caterpillar: it was a female and came out from its chrysalis shut up in my cage: the windows were open in the room or closet where it was kept, and two male moths flying round were caught by my wife who by a lucky chance were into the room in the night: they were attracted, as it seems to me, by the scent of the female and came in from outside.

The film that I am in the process of finishing is complicated to finalize, although actually, for me, it is finished.
There are two versions of the film for now: mine and his … which I find catastrophic.
It’s got hardly anything to do with the film.
It’s only about the money, the release strategy, millions of dollars and stuff like that.
It’s got nothing to do with cinema.
I mean, of course it’s about cinema, but the business side.
They want a commercial film smelling of daisies, taking out anything that exceeds that which is too abrupt, everything that makes it cinematic and breathe with life.
A lot of things are missing.
It was fated merely to touch upon perfection, and then, as if withered by some untimely blight, to rapidly decline to the third era, when the enthusiasm for the revival of the Pagan arts and literature, joined with the influence of the Reformation's devastating principles, caused its total neglect, but fortunately, not its destruction.
one of the finest pathetic airs that can be found in all his works This air is rendered affecting by new and curious modulation, as well as by the general cast of the melody.
Protected areas set aside to protect a specific natural monument, which can be a landform, sea mount, submarine cavern, geological feature such as a cave, or even a living feature such as an ancient grove.

FOR Mr. Whistler's own sake, no less than for the protection of the purchaser, Sir Coutts Lindsay ought not to have admitted works into the gallery in which the ill-educated conceit of the artist so nearly approached the aspect of wilful imposture.

When we talk about heterosexuality, we talk about that wild range of activities.When we talk about homosexuality, we focus on the sex part of it.This is not the only time we get the sort of false contrast.
I mean we say things … Heterosexual people, we talk about relationships.Homosexual people, we talk about sex.We say: Heterosexual people have ‘lives’.Homosexual people have ‘lifestyles’.We say: Heterosexual people have a moral vision.Homosexual people have an agenda.The words we use to talk about these things really affect our way of thinking about them.
Certainly the results are not all that spontaneous, but Davis is in top form and some of the selections (most notably the title cut) are quite memorable.

It is unlawful to designate the Armenian assets as "abandoned goods" for the Armenians, the proprietors, did not abandon their properties voluntarily; they were forcibly, compulsorily removed from their domiciles and exiled.
Now the government through its efforts is selling their goods… If we are a constitutional regime functioning in accordance with constitutional law we can’t do this.
This is atrocious.
Grab my arm, eject me from my village, then sell my goods and properties, such a thing can never be permissible.
Neither the conscience of the Ottomans nor the law can allow it.

As there should be no feature about a Church that has not a purpose or a meaning, buttresses should be only used where they are necessary for the strengthening of the building, and then they should be sufficient for their purpose, and treated boldly.
It is one of the faults of modern Gothic work, to introduce buttresses merely as ornamental features.
The use of buttresses is to resist pressure; and if decoration can be afforded, they may be rendered very ornamental, thus uniting utility with beauty.

It's so bad, maybe you should pool your money and draw straws and send one of the guys off to rent it so that in the future, whenever you think you're sitting through a bad comedy, he could shake his head, and chuckle tolerantly, and explain that you don't know what bad is.
archaeologists do not need to be failed ethnographers, forever regretting the demise of the people they would like to talk to. archaeology should investigate the past in a way that plays to archaeologists´ strengths.

I just thought, 'well, what am I going to sing?'
At the time, there was a lot of conversation about what to do.
It was decided that it was so far away in time and influence that...well, you only get caught when you're successful.
That's the game.
In a peak experience, the presence of divinity became almost palpable and I knew that life in the universe was not just an accident based on random processes.
The knowledge came to me directly — noetically.
It was not a matter of discursive reasoning or logical abstraction.
It was an experiential cognition.

It is true that the third section of the first article of the Constitution authorizes Congress to lay and collect an impost duty, but it is granted as a tax power for the sole purpose of revenue, a power in its nature essentially different from that of imposing protective or prohibitory dutiesThe Constitution grants to Congress the power of imposing a duty on imports for revenue, which power is abused by being converted into an instrument of rearing up the industry of one section of the country on the ruins of another.
The violation, then, consists in using a power granted for one object to advance another

Shared libraries are the work of the devil, the one true sign that the apocalypse is at hand.
they erected a secular structure: the television tower at Alexander Platz.
Virtually ever since, the authorities have been working to correct what they view as the tower’s one major flaw, treating the glass sphere at the top with paints and chemicals of every kind.
Yet even today when the Sun strikes that sphere – that sphere that towers over all Berlin – the light makes the sign of the cross.
It’s a potent return to form for Takahashi, then, a glowing comeback for the Japanese RPG, and an injection of creativity for some tired hardware.
Xenoblade Chronicles manages to impress, enrich and, best of all, inspire wonder.
The Baptist denomination and the University of Chicago owe a debt to Dr. Goodspeed beyond computation.
It was to his vigor and indefatigable courage that the Theological Seminary owed its steady development in resources, and it was to him also that we, to whom the Morgan Park Seminary is only a memory, owe so much, not only for the prosperity of the Divinity School, but for the very foundation of the present University itself.
A protected area where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced an area of distinct charcter with significant, ecological, biological, cultural and scenic value: and where safeguarding the integrity of this interaction is vital to protecting and sustaining the area and its associated nature conservation and other values.

Miyamoto's first game changed the world, because it simultaneously broke new ground in nearly every area possible: character, game play, music, graphics, narrative, and cinematic.
decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.
The big value of Windows is the fact that it’s old technology that runs everyone’s apps.

In the interest of Poland's security and detente in Europe, having agreed the initiative with other members of the Warsaw Pact, the Government of the Polish People's Republic declares that if both German states agree to the introduction of a ban on a production and storage of nuclear weapons on their territory, the Polish People's Republic is prepared to introduce on its territory the same ban.

I haven't spoken to them since I left.

You can’t regret it; there are always reasons for doing something, even if it's just the location.
throughout the weeks before the disengagement, and during the evacuation itself, the Israeli media repeatedly warned of potential violent confrontation between settlers and security forces.
These scenarios, which never materialized, took over the headlines.

These days, most of the patches in the kernel don't actually get sent directly to me.
That not just wouldn't scale, but the fact is, there's a lot of subsystems I have no clue about, and thus no way of judging how good the patch is.
So I end up seeing mostly the maintainers of the subsystem, and when a bug happens, what I want to see is the maintainer name, not a random developer who I don't even know if he is active any more.
So at least for me, the _chain_ is actually mostly more important than the actual originator.
There is also another issue, namely the fact than when I (or anybody else, for that matter) get an emailed patch, the only thing I can see directly is the sender information, and that's the part I trust.
When Andrew sends me a patch, I trust it because it comes from him – even if the original author may be somebody I don't know.
So the _path_ the patch came in through actually documents that chain of trust – we all tend to know the „next hop“, but we do _not_ necessarily have direct knowledge of the full chain.
So what I'm suggesting is that we start „signing off“ on patches, to show the path it has come through, and to document that chain of trust.
It also allows middle parties to edit the patch without somehow „losing“ their names – quite often the patch that reaches the final kernel is not exactly the same as the original one, as it has gone through a few layers of people.
Science aims to give us theories which are empirically adequate; and acceptance of a theory involves as belief only that it is empirically adequate.
This is the statement of the anti-realist position I advocate; I shall call it constructive empiricism.
Without Contraries is no progression.
Attraction and Repulsion, Reason and Energy, Love and Hate, are necessary to Human existence.
From these contraries spring what the religious call Good & Evil.
Good is the passive that obeys Reason.
Evil is the active springing from Energy.
Good is Heaven.
Evil is Hell.

We should remember what happened in the village of Racak back in January – innocent men, women and children taken from their homes to a gully, forced to kneel in the dirt, sprayed with gunfire, not because of anything they had done but because of who they were.
Now, roughly 40,000 Serbian troops and police are massing in and around Kosovo.
Our firmness is the only thing standing between them and countless more villages like Racak, full of people without protection, even though they have now chosen peace.
Make no mistake, if we and our allies do not have the will to act, there will be more massacres.
In dealing with aggressors in the Balkans, hesitation is a license to kill.
But action and resolve can stop armies and save lives.

Contrary to popular belief, the LOOM sequels were not abandoned because LOOM didn't sell well.
LOOM has sold more than half a million copies in various formats since it was published in 1990.
The reason the sequels weren't made is because I decided I wanted to work on other things, and nobody else wanted to do them, either.
At that time the console was about this big with four faders on it.
And there was one speaker right in the middle and that was it. When they invented stereo, I remember thinking ‘Why?
What do you want two speakers for?’, because it ruined the sound from our point of view.
You know, we had everything coming out of one speaker; now it had to come out of two speakers.
It sounded like… very… naked.
688 Attack Sub is for the man (or woman) who like their submarine sim sophisticated, efficient, characterless and excitement-free.
It's for the kind of person who'd choose a Nissan Micra over a 205 GTI.
Thrills and atmosphere are short in supply – you never get the feeling you're actually sitting at the helm of a submarine.
Silent Service 2 would be a much better alternative .
The longest lifetime is observed for cells cycled with low peak currents and a narrow SOC range.
In addition, high charge current is found to affect the cycle life profoundly.
On the contrary, a moderate temperature increase did not result in a shorter cycle life.
Forasmuch as the wearing of long haire after the manner of Ruffians and barbarous Indians, hath begun to invade new England contrary to the rule of gods word ...

The visitors included all classes from capitalists to the pauper, the clergyman to the pickpocket, well-dressed ladies and those whose garb and bearing hinted of the social outcast, however, the garb of the laboring man predominated.
The modern Japanese factory is not, as many Americans believe, a prototype of the factory of the future.
If it were, it might be, curiously, far less of a threat.
We in the United States, with our technical ability and resources, ought then to be able to duplicate it.
Instead, it is something much more difficult for us to copy; it is the factory of today running as it should.

These facts few psychologists will dispute, and their admitted truth must establish for all time the genuineness and dignity of the weirdly horrible tales as a literary form.
Pan Am romanticizes the past, whereas Mad Men, on AMC, takes pleasure in slyly mocking antiquated mores.
If only for the costumes and ’60s music, Pan Am is amusing to see at least once, but if it has any instructive benefit at all, it’s as a mood indicator for these times, not those.
This is not really pro-circumcision.
It falls in the middle.
It’s pro-choice, for lack of a better word.
Really, what we’re saying is, ‚This ought to be a choice that’s available to parents.‘

Interviewer: Is it true „Whole Lotta Love“ was written on stage during a gig in America, when you were all jamming on a Garnett Mimms song?
Page: No.
No.
Absolutely incorrect.
No, it was put together when we were rehearsing some music for the second album.
I had a riff, everyone was at my house, and we kicked it from there.
Never was it written during a gig.
Mr. Handel has got a new singer from Italy, her voice is between Cuzzoni's and Strada's – strong, but not harsh, her person miserably bad, being very low, and excessively crooked.

What did you do?
You determined deliberately in cold blood to starve out one-third of the population of this city, to break the manhood of the men by the sight of the suffering of their wives and the hunger of their children.
You may succeed in your policy the men whose manhood you have broken will loath you The children will be taught to curse you.
on the basis of the declarations which Your Excellency has made several times regarding the necessity of defending principles of international justice and the right of peoples to liberty. I beg Your Excellency to take efficacious and urgent humanitarian steps to put an end to these acts of aggression.
This incident brings into war a neutral and pacific country which has had no other care than the safeguarding of tranquillity and the reform of the country.
It is impossible for us, your comrades up to now, to allow your fine ships to fall into the power of the German enemy.
We are determined to fight on until the end, and if we win, as we think we shall, we shall never forget that France was our Ally, that our interests are the same as hers, and that our common enemy is Germany.
Should we conquer we solemnly declare that we shall restore the greatness and territory of France.
For this purpose we must make sure that the best ships of the French Navy are not used against us by the common foe.
In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government have instructed me to demand that the French Fleet now at Mers el Kebir and Oran shall act in accordance with one of the following alternatives; :(a) Sail with us and continue the fight until victory against the Germans. :(b) Sail with reduced crews under our control to a British port.
The reduced crews would be repatriated at the earliest moment.
If either of these courses is adopted by you we will restore your ships to France at the conclusion of the war or pay full compensation if they are damaged meanwhile. :(c) Alternatively if you feel bound to stipulate that your ships should not be used against the Germans unless they break the Armistice, then sail them with us with reduced crews to some French port in the West Indies — Martinique for instance — where they can be demilitarised to our satisfaction, or perhaps be entrusted to the United States and remain safe until the end of the war, the crews being repatriated.
If you refuse these fair offers, I must with profound regret, require you to sink your ships within 6 hours.
Finally, failing the above, I have the orders from His Majesty's Government to use whatever force may be necessary to prevent your ships from falling into German hands.
Bernachi has a vast compass, his voice mellow and clear, but not so sweet as Senesino, his manner better; his person not so good, for he is as big as a Spanish friar.
Fabri has a tenor voice, sweet, clear, and firm, but not strong enough, I doubt, for the stage: he sings like a gentleman, without making faces, and his manner is particularly agreeable; he is the greatest master of musick that ever sung upon the stage.
The third is the bass, a very good distinct voice, without any harshness.
La Strada is the first woman; her voice is without exception fine, her manner perfection, but her person very bad, and she makes frightful mouths.
La Merighi is the next to her; her voice is not extraordinarily good or bad, she is tall and has a very graceful person, with a tolerable face; she seems to be a woman about forty, she sings easily and agreeably.
The last is Bertoli, she has neither voice, ear, nor manner to recommend her; but she is a perfect beauty, quite a Cleopatra, that sort of complexion with regular features, fine teeth, and when she sings has a smile about her mouth which is extreme pretty, and I believe has practised to sing before a glass, for she has never any distortion in her face.
Static characters make poor protagonists — unfortunate, given how fine-tuned and sympathetic Joel Murray’s performance is.
I had the same thought when the movie was over that Frank probably has on a regular basis: Is this all there is?
My dear Mr. Miaskowsky,I have not yet replied to your kind letter of March 29 th .
I wish to say that I greatly admire you for the splendid work you are doing as a composer of excellent music.
I feel that the time will come when your symphonies will be just as well known as any of those by Tschaikowsky or any of your predecessors.I accept with gratitude the dedication of your Thirteenth Symphony and shall repeat this and several of your major works on my programs in Chicago as well as on tour during the coming year.Our mutual friend Prokofieff joins me in my highest estimation and admiration of your genius and I hope it will be possible for me before long to pay you a visit in Moscow so that I may have the pleasure of a personal acquaintance with you.In the meantime, I am, with renewed expressions of highest esteem and most cordial greetings,very sincerely yours,Frederick A.

Where most rappers present themselves as funky individualists, beating the odds of the status quo, Public Enemy suggests that rap listeners can become an active community, not just an audience.
Although it overreaches, It Takes a Nation jams urban tension and black anger into the foreground; it reveals the potential for demagoguery as well as the need for change.

A pop record with a disco feel, catchy chorus and a bit of French to make it sound ‚European‘, it was well-dressed but superficial, all trousers and no mouth.
I love idyllic places and the kind of suspension of history they offer.
But noble beauty is not enough these days.
One must complicate the picture, because there’s now nowhere to ‘escape’ to on the planet in pursuit of a hermetic pastoralism or a redemptive wilderness sublime.
Earth is now a human park.
Poro, with its background of Oriental romance, was instantly a success.
Never did Senesino in all his London singing rise to a greater height than with the air ‘Se possono tanto’.
He had never been out of favour, now he attained in one night a far greater popularity than ever.
In a week all London was humming the airs Many declared that Poro was the best opera he had given London.

I wanted to blow their heads off.
It is politically incorrect in terms of race and race relations, but in a very Brazilian way. I think it is a portrait of our melange. … It engages in the discovery of the contradictions of our people.

it has been said that a German can understand Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason only if he reads it in English.

a modern Parisian restaurant in decoration and a luxurious one at that.
The carpet is wine colour, the curtains are of patterned yellow brocade; over the mantelpiece is a painting of a dinner table ... the lounge portion of the room is illuminated and decorated by a square of hanging silk balloon lights.
In a prominent place is an immense bottle of 1869 liqueur brandy de la maison, a graceful reminder that the place studies drink equally with meat.
what makes Eye of the Storm much better than average is the very smooth, fast polygonal 3D graphics that is much more advanced than most space opera games of the time.
Ship handling is excellent, and in contrast to pure space action games such as Wing Commander series, you'll really feel that you are fighting in space.
While Eye of the Storm won't take the crown away from Elite or Wing Commander, it's a fun space simulation that deserve a closer look.

And the basic issue was National Health Insurance, civil rights, liberal attitudes favoring labor, minimum wage and all that sort of thing.
Adequate hospital and medical care for the people, those things were basically the issues.
And of course, the McCarthy stuff was simply the coloration of it.
It was an excuse, it was simply a manifestation of that extreme right-wing conservative attitude that was beginning to grow stronger and stronger.
And since that time, we have seen more Republicans elected...
In my opinion and in the opinion of Orthodox canonists, this is phyletism.
This is heretical.
How can we condemn phyletism as a heresy in 1872 and still practice the same kind of phyletism in the twenty-first century here in North America?
Heute wie damals ist meine Sorge nicht technischer Natur – bezogen auf die Effizienz des Systems -, sondern bezogen auf die sozialen und politischen Aspekte, bezogen auf die normalen Menschen, die niemals gefragt wurden, ob sie ihre Arbeitsplätze, ihre Ersparnisse, ihr Einkommen in dieser kasinoartigen Form des Kapitalismus aufs Spiel setzen wollten.
The Anderson Memorial Bridge replaces the inadequate, old wooden draw bridge which for many years had marked the former condition of the banks of Charles River.
The new bridge was made possible by the gift of the Honorable Larz Anderson as a memorial to his father, a gallant general of the United States Army, Nicholas Longworth Anderson, renowned for his part in the American Civil War.
More precisely, parrhesia is a verbal activity in which a speaker expresses his personal relationship to truth, and risks his life because he recognizes truth-telling as a duty to improve or help other people (as well as himself).
In parrhesia, the speaker uses his freedom and chooses frankness instead of persuasion, truth instead of falsehood or silence, the risk of death instead of life and security, criticism instead of flattery, and moral duty instead of self-interest and moral apathy.

Court is determined to find in favour of Nicaragua in this case.
Much of the evidence that would establish Nicaragua’s aggression against its neighbours is of a highly sensitive intelligence character.
We will not risk U.S. national security by presenting such sensitive material in public or before a Court that includes two judges from Warsaw Pact Nations.
Ringo is a damn good drummer.
He is not technically good, but I think Ringo’s drumming is underrated the same way Paul’s bass playing is underrated. I think Paul and Ringo stand up with any of the rock musicians.
By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice, whether it's anti-Semitism or an acceptance of anti-Semitism.
Later, jazz buffs would vilify Jones for not taking fuller advantage of this one-time constellation of jazz stars, but at the time, it seemed like a marvelous dialogue between the old and the new… .Yet Back on the Block remains a strikingly durable piece of entertainment, and in hindsight, a poignant signpost of the changing of the guard.
I enjoy it, I suppose, but I never thought I’d be a novelist.
I never wanted to be a novelist.
I can’t bear fiction.
I hate it.
It’s so untidy.

… Quincy Jones still owed one more album to A&M -- and he gave them a blockbuster, one that reached number ten, yielded three hit pop singles and made a star out of soul balladeer James Ingram.
Ai No Corrida, and the leadoff track, is the Quincy Jones hit method par excellence -- great pacing, superb sound, a catchy tune, a hot Ernie Watts tenor sax solo and you can dance to it, too. … .Obviously, though, the main purpose here is to make hit pop singles, and The Dude does a pretty good job of that.
In our dreams, we have limitless resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands.

We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into Philosophers or men of learning, or men of science.
We have not to raise up from among them authors, editors, poets or men of letters.
We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen, of whom we have an ample supply.
The task we set before ourselves is very simple as well as a very beautiful one, to train these people as we find them to a perfectly ideal life just where they are.
So we will organize our children and teach them to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect way, in the homes, in the shops and on the farm.

23 seasons in, The Simpsons is as creatively vibrant as ever and beloved by millions around the world.
We believe this brilliant series can and should continue, but we cannot produce future seasons under its current financial model.

Should we blame Prokofiev for creating the great film score for Ivan Grozny, which interpreted history according to Stalin's dictatorial purposes, or Shostakovich for writing his ballets based on a typical soviet propagandist cliche?
Should we blame Myaskovsky for his Kolkhoz or Aviation (Sixteenth) symphonies?
Or for receiving Stalin's prize or simply for survival?
I do not believe so.
To differing degrees, they all experienced enormous inner tragedy and frustration; the deprivation of their freedom of speech and self-expression, the almost complete lack of outside information, the constant accompaniment of Soviet propaganda and official orders, i.e., what to write, how to write.
To survive emotionally and artistically, Shostakovich had his anger and irony, Prokofiev, his enormous vitality and foreign experience.
Myaskovsky did not have any of that.
I found the communists very dull and rather stupid.
I love AC/DC If it wasn’t for Angus , I wouldn’t be playing guitar.
I’ve only said ‘Wow!’ a few times in the last couple decades of playing games.
One of those times was for the breakthrough Super Mario 64, a game that took action/platforming into a 3D world and made it work.
It’s fitting that I said it again over its (true) sequel, Super Mario Galaxy, a game that took action/platforming even more into 3D and made that work, too.

It’s not a new album, it’s more like an afterthought, it’s the Paradise edition of Born to Die.
It’s like seven new songs that kind of put a period on the statement that I was making when I was making the record.

The closest comparisons might be to MC5 or the Stooges—both from Michigan—yet neither had the polish or prowess of Led Zeppelin, nor did Led Zeppelin have the political, social or die-hard sensibility of those landmark bands.
What they did have, though, was the potential for a mass audience.
This obelisk marks the spot where the body of Tommy Jones, aged 5, was found.
He lost his way between Cwm Llwch farm and the Login on the night of August 4, 1900.
After an anxious search of 29 days his remains were discovered on September 1.

While some considered the bodywork cutting edge, more thought it was just plain weird.
And while performance was good, the K1’s solid-mounted engine was faulted for mid-range buzziness.
Worse yet, at speeds below 50 mph many testers found the heat pouring from under the K1’s bodywork unbearable.
Bob, the hurricane, knocked out all the power; it was all candlelight, cooking on a woodfire.
Very primitive, but we like that enforced simplicity.
I couldn’t play records, so I made up little acoustic pieces.
This was one of them.
Overall, the major economic reforms of the last five years, the deregulation of the finance sector, and the imposition of wage restraint through the social contract of The Accord, have worked to expand employment and internationalize the Australian economy in more positive ways than I thought possible at the time.
Vizcaya Bridge, through the development of the hanging transporter mechanism and its fusion of iron working technology with new steel cables, created a new form of construction that influenced the development of bridges around the world over the next three decades and exported French and Spanish technologies.
We hadn’t got our own way and so with Ha!
Ha!
Ha! we were out to piss off as many people as possible.
We knew it was going to do jack shit in terms of sales so we just left stuff in there like all the feedback at the end of Fear in the Western World.

I had said this before that we do not have any hostility against the Israeli people and I still say the same thing proudly
Frage: Is this album a rest away from the Beatles or the start of a solo career? McCartney: Time will tell.
Being a solo means it’s ‘the start of a solo career… ’ and not being done with the Beatles means it’s just a rest. So it’s both really.
Frage: Is your break with the Beatles temporary or permanent, due to personal differences or musical ones? McCartney: Personal differences, business differences, musical differences, but most of all because I have a better time with my family.
Temporary or permanent?
I don’t really know. Frage: Do you foresee a time when Lennon/McCartney becomes an active songwriting partnership again?McCartney: No.
Names, titles and things like that do not mean a thing.
there’s a tribute going on in this next week or the week after us, over in England, for George Harrison and ah you know there’s all kinds of people in it… I’m not quite sure who, but ah we can’t make it and I just wanted to do this song in rememberence of George cos we were such good buddies.
Most of our evils arise from legislative interference.
The author firmly believes the Toyota production system can play a great role in the task for improving the constitutions of American and European companies …
Damn her! she has got a nest of nightingales in her belly.
StumpWM grew out of the authors' frustration with writing ratpoison in C. Very quickly we realized we were building into ratpoison lispy-emacs style paradigms.
We had a REPL hanging off 'C-t :', hooks, and a growing subset of Common Lisp in the implementation. It was clear what we REALLY wanted was a window manager written in Lisp from the ground up with lots of room for customizing and real-time hacking.
My spirit is not banned—I still say I want freedom in my lifetime.
Emacs is a great operating system – it lacks a good editor, though.
It is a real education, after watching this you will not be in favour of nuclear weapons.
I said Mr. Purple People Eater, what's your line, He said it's eatin' purple people and it sure is fine.
Luke is a historian of the first rank; not merely are his statements of fact trustworthy this author should be placed among with the very greatest of historians.
Freedom of thought begins with the right to ask questions and this right our people in Burma have not had for so long that some of our young people do not quite know how to ask questions.
Lyrically this is a record about the ups and downs of being young through the eyes of someone who loved and hated it all the same time.
even if disks are failing, network routes are flapping, or data centers are being destroyed by tornados.
We had appalling press at the time.
Nobody seemed to want to know us for one reason or another.
We got to America and read the Rolling Stone review of the very first album, which was going on about us as another hyped British band.
We couldn't believe it.
In our naivety we thought we'd done a good album and were doing all right, and then this venom comes flying out.
We couldn't understand why or what we'd done to them.
After that we were very wary of the press, which became a chicken-and-egg situation.
We avoided them and so they avoided us.
It was only because we did a lot of shows that our reputation got around as a good live band.
It was no trick for Southey, a consummate technician, to recreate the improvisational tone of an Uncle William through rhythmical reiteration, artful alliteration ('they walked into the woods, while'), even bardic interpolation ('She could not have been a good, honest Old Woman')
Small problems aside, Shadow Sorcerer is a welcome improvement to previous action releases in the series and yet another refinement to a gaming system that is showing remarkable versatility.

… This series seems to more assuredly offer a first-class version of what so many viewers say they want: a humorous, heartfelt, realistic look at middle-class, middle-America family life.
I have recently given a performance on an entirely new and costly organ belonging to an influential Corporation and I can confidently say there is no comparison to be made between the two instruments, so superior is M. Cavaillé-Coll’s.
Of course as you know, the engine has only six cylinders; however, the NSX's very rigid chassis is excellent and would easily be capable of handling more power.
Although it's true I had thought it would have been better to put a larger engine, the moment I drove the „little“ NSX, all the benchmark cars – Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini – I had been using as references in the development of my car vanished from my mind.
Of course the car we would create, the McLaren F1, needed to be faster than the NSX, but the NSX's ride quality and handling would become our new design target.
The time has come for us brights to come out of the closet.
What is a bright?
A bright is a person with a naturalist as opposed to a supernaturalist world view.
We brights don’t believe in ghosts or elves or the Easter Bunny -- or God.
Jürgen had a flattened-down hairstyle with a fringe in the front, which we rather took to.
We went over to his place and there and then he cut – hacked would be a better word – our hair into the same style.
real relationship with his wife, who is pregnant with their child.
To me, that was the beautiful hopeful ending.
Now the irony of it is, the end is cyclical because no matter what we commit to in what we decide we want our lives to be, there's always the biological, psychological aspects that will torment us at times.
The development of the amphibian tractor, or LVT, which began in the middle 1930s provided the solution and was one of the most important modern technical contributions to ships-to-shore operations.
Without these landing vehicles our amphibious offensive in the Pacific would have been impossible.
The ability of a nation to apply all or some of its elements of national power - political, economic, informational, or military - to rapidly and effectively deploy and sustain forces in and from multiple dispersed locations to respond to crises, to contribute to deterrence, and to enhance regional stability.
Dear Hitch, It was heartbreaking for me to have to leave the picture.
I was so excited about doing it and particularly about working with you again.
When we meet I would like to explain to you myself all of the reasons which is difficult to do by letter or through a third party.
It is unfortunate that it had to happen this way and I am deeply sorry.
Thank you dear Hitch for being so understanding and helpful I hate disappointing you.
I also hate the fact that there are probably many other «cattle» who could play the part equally as well.
Despite that I hope to remain one of your «sacred cows».
Yeah, I had a lot of bad times in the 60s.
We used to lie in bed and wonder what was going on and feel quite paranoid.
Probably all the drugs.
I had a dream one night about my mother.
She died when I was fourteen so I hadn’t really heard from her in quite some while, and it was very good.
It gave me some strength.
In my darkest hour, Mother Mary comes to me.
I was getting very famous at the time and I felt I needed to brush up on various aspects of my craft.
I felt I was getting too much, too soon, so I said, wait a minute, I'm going to do it my way.
I wasn't going to let people push me out there, so I could fall down.
I wanted to get myself together, on my own.
I used to practice on the Bridge, the Williamsburg Bridge because I was living on the Lower East Side at the time.
While Bioshock Infinite will likely distort the concept of American Exceptionalism, at least it will get us talking about it.
That’s more than can be said of the average first-person shooter game, and perhaps the distinction between mindless entertainment and a semblance of art.
John Sturges (… ) has made infinitely better films than this one. (… ) The photography is undeniably beautiful, but there comes a point when we’ve had too many mountains and too little plot.
I never had the power/control to force my name on a box of anything.
EA legal and marketing decided it was a good way to establish a version of the "Alice" name which they could own and control.
The strategy here is you pull them in, you get them to write a big cheque, and they have to support that money if they saw the enormity of it up front they might say the cost to tax payers is too high if it looks big enough to be important, but not too big that it spoils everything, then I think you have a chance.
Heroes of the Lance is a quality product that will leave most players with the strong conviction that TSR selected the right company to produce the computer versions of AD&D products.
If you like an action/strategy blend in a fantasy game, this product is for you.
Since touring 'Ultra Beatdown', we can even hear the monitors now, and that makes pretty much hundreds, hundreds of difference in terms of our playing. (… ) Not hearing and playing guitar is very difficult; you play guitar out of key and sometimes you just can't hear it.
Since we've had in-ear monitors, our playing has gone through the roof.
Certain papers delivered to you by Colonel Ritchie contain quadrant decisions covering operation against the Japanese.
It is requested that you forward by 1 November 1943 outline plans for your operations to seize Kavieng and Admiralty Islands and for your advances in New Guinea as far west as Vogelkop ....
This information is necessary for the integration of operations in your area with other approved operations against the Japanese in 1943-1944, particularly those to be conducted in the Japanese Mandates.
seems to fire on all cylinders, their amps cranked up to ten (maybe 11 for Casady), and Balin, Slick, and Kantner stretching out on the disjointed yet oddly compelling tune and lyrics.
It didn't work 100 percent, but it made for a shattering finish to the album.
This is a belief that business and, by implication, both entrepreneurs and managers, are the key engines of both economic and social progress.
It is business that creates and distributes most of an economy's wealth, that innovates, trades and raises the living standards of people.
So business is and must be a force of good
The occasion seems suitable for all Christian princes to come to the help of His Majesty, to avenge as befits, the dreadful and never-before-heard-of deed …
After sales had plummeted to 60,000 and a review of guitar instrumentalist Duane Eddy had been printed which began with the immortal words 'On this, his 35th album, we find Duane in as good as voice as ever,' the NME had been told to rethink its policies or die on the vine.
Suppose you have a man having a nervous breakdown, and a youngster comes after him.

We hear that the Royal Academy Musick, in the Hay Market, have contracted with famous Chauntess for 2500 l. who is coming over from Italy against the Winter.
It was more than a dream come true because I had never dreamed it.
I dig the album in part because it varies in almost every song, but somehow it doesn't stray from the core elements of what the band is known for; good or bad.
A very fitting ending to a very diverse album with a statement by SGT Major: "enjoy the quiet, now"!
Air, water and land comprise the physical surroundings of man.
Collectively, they may be called the GEOSPHERE or the earth’s environment, which includes three systems: ATMOSPHERE, HYDROSPHERE and LITHOSPHERE.
The overture to Faramond is one of the most pleasing of all Handel's opera overtures.
Nothing can be more grand than the opening, or more free and spirited than the fugue; and as to the air, it speaks intelligibly to all ears.
There were two people that had a heavy influence on Sierra: Bill Gates and Walt Disney.
These two companies were our role models.
I read every book written on both companies.
I did everything to try to understand how they thought, and how they did business.
Terror have cemented their status in great stone letters as guardians of old school hardcore ethics while winning the pit fervor of the new generation of metal and hardcore fans.
Each designer follows his own caprice; one borrows decorations from Pagan antiquities, which have no reference to, and by no means illustrate the character or teaching of the Christian religion, but are rather in direct contradiction to both; another draws from the common domestic or profane buildings of the day.
One of the things I want to do on the next album is to make music that is so incredibly sweet, really touching.
"General Spanky" is one of those films that will have you sitting in stunned silence, not knowing exactly what you are watching.
Overall, Beyond the Missouri Sky is a fine record when the material is happening, but a bit of a chore when it is not.
If Haden and Metheny had gone with the more Americana theme throughout, instead of interspersing that rootsy feel with post-bop, it would have been a much stronger record.
Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought.
A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient and well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.
Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override.
For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others.
So, tonight, the Conservative Party, which wants the Act repealed and opposes even devolution, will march through the Lobby with the SNP, which wants independence for Scotland, and with the Liberals, who want to keep the Act.
What a massive display of unsullied principle!
The minority parties have walked into a trap.
If they win, there will be a general election.
I am told that the current joke going around the House is that it is the first time in recorded history that turkeys have been known to vote for an early Christmas.
Blaze Foley was a genius and a beautiful loser.
for whereas of his earlier operas, that is to say, those composed by him between the years 1710 and 1728, the merits are so great, that few are able to say which is to be preferred; those composed after that period have so little to recommend them In the former class are Radamistus, Otho, Tamerlane, Rodelinda, Alexander, and Admetus, in either of which scarcely an indifferent air occurs

I'm reinventing myself and I feel fearless, (...)
I haven't done R&B in a very long time. This album is rooted in R&B. The sound is different, it's about love.
It's mature, it's gritty, it's edgy.
B-side, 'Blue Jeans' is equally transfixing.
She coos, 'I grew up on hip-hop', and it shows.
The track could sit comfortably on any urban release from Nineties-era Aaliyah to 2011’s The Weekend.
The Minimalist beat almost recalls early Timbaland, but with plenty of Del Rey’s Retro leanings.
Lines that could be lifted straight out of a rap hit ('you’re so fresh to death and sick as cancer', 'love you more than those bitches before') flow seamlessly into the chorus’s tragic promise, 'I will love you till the end of time, I would wait a Million years.'
B-Sides should never Sound this good.
Many are absolutely incurable and the victim may be compelled to carry the marks of this practice and their accompanying discomforts through a long life.
And now, emboldened by the sonority of the place, I did the Gloria the most tempestuous and, I thought, the best number of all.
At a certain drum effect a foot, even, came into play, and I fancy that as regards volume of sound at least, the presence of a real chorus and orchestra was scarcely missed!
This time, fortified by the simplicity and genuineness of the Sovereign's appreciation, I thought I would risk a glance at the faces of her terrifying Court.
What matter if astonishment and secret scandalisation be there depicted?
I was well down in the saddle now, not easily to be thrown!
I glanced.
They were stupendous.
No surprise, no emotion of any kind! a spectacle so exciting, because so fantastic, that the result was a finale to that Gloria such as I had never before succeeded in wresting out!
Today it is Palestine, tomorrow it will be one country or another.
The Zionist plan is limitless.
After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates.
When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on.
Their plan is embodied in the ‚Protocols of the Elders of Zion‘, and their present conduct is the best proof of what we are saying.
Last Night the famous Signora Strada arriv’d from Holland, who is come on purpose to sing next Thursday in a Concert of Musick at the Swan Tavern in Exchange-Alley.
Well, that’s the first line.
Then it drifts off into some other things.
I’ve always believed that you need a truthful first line to kick you off into a song.
You have to say something emotionally true before you can let your imagination wander.
If organisational culture is funnelled through the unconscious and is therefore not always orderly, then it is unlikely that efforts to manage such a culture can be precisely predicted or tightly controlled
Many people ask what are Beatles?
Why Beatles?
Ugh, Beatles, how did the name arrive?
So we will tell you.
It came in a vision – a man appeared on a flaming pie and said unto them ‘From this day on you are Beatles with an A’. ‘Thank you, Mister Man’, they said, thanking him.
There must be a lot of people around scratching their heads wondering why they didn’t get into Ultravox...
The most plausible reason for the band never having more than a cult following and hence not devastating the album charts is they were unfashionable at the time when the music press was at its most influential...
Freedom to order their Actions, and dispose of their Possessions and Persons as they think fit, within the bounds of the Law of Nature, without asking leave, or depending upon the Will of any other man.
Jethro Tull’s audaciously ambitious 1972 concept album, Thick As a Brick, made prog-rock history.
For the album's 40th anniversary, frontman Ian Anderson – sans Tull – has crafted a sequel that’s just as ambitious as its predecessor.
Like the original, Thick As a Brick 2 comprises one continuous, album-length suite with a linear lyrical narrative but multiple shifts in feel.
Trying to follow in the footsteps of such a classic-rock staple could easily have been disastrous, but Anderson triumphs against the odds.
Even without his Tull mates, he convincingly picks up where he left off four decades earlier, proving that there are still vital sonic statements to be made within the old-school prog-rock realm.
The Scene represented only y e Country of Arcadia y e Habits were old. – y e opera short.
Linus is a good developer, but is a terrible engineer.
I'm sure that he'll agree with me.
Poetry slam is the competitive art of performance poetry.
Established in the mid-80s as a means to heighten public interest in poetry readings, slam has evolved into an international art form emphasizing audience involvement and poetic excellence.

As a damn good entertainer; nothing spectacular.
A good entertainer who made people enjoy themselves and made them laugh a little.
He was a nice guy.
He did pretty good and we loved him, that's all.
BUT - when it comes to bands like Crush Evil, we must take serious action.
It’s bad enough to have a couple of society bands, but a CHRISTIAN band is too much.
But don't worry, we have plans.
They will not continue for a very long time.
The great condemnation of the German people was that they stood aside and did nothing when dreadful things happened.
Now, a three-quarter witted boy of nineteen is to be hanged for a murder he did not commit and which was committed fifteen minutes after he was arrested.
Can we be made to keep silent when a thing as horrible and as shocking as this is to happen?
From what I understand there was no person involved in those murders from within Snowtown or the surrounding district.
They were murdered elsewhere and the drums were brought to Snowtown because it was a quiet little town and there was a premises ideal for the persons involved.
This album is dedicated to Paul McGuinness who was, and always will be, there for us.
A very simple, very memorable episode with superb guest cameos from the McCartneys.
In a similar fashion to the filmic depiction of National Socialist heroes, Irish nationalists are honoured by sacrificial death, their spirit living on in the memory as martyrs, further emphasizing the contemporary connection between the struggle of minority groupings against British ambitions and the proclaimed purpose of World War II and Nazi propaganda.
An operational data store is a subject-oriented, integrated, volatile, current-valued, detailed-only collection of data in support of an organization's need for up-to-the-second, operational, integrated, collective information.
And the waters of Bodom turn a deep red shade of blood, as the Children Of Bodom take their last breath.
I felt Hitler was a case of a man who was neither fish, flesh nor fowl, neither fully homosexual nor fully heterosexual. I had formed the firm conviction that he was impotent, the repressed, masturbating type.
Knowing how the government spies on us is important.
Not only because so much of it is illegal — or, to be as charitable as possible, based on novel interpretations of the law — but because we have a right to know.
Kelso was as gentle as could be.
He could jump over big fences.
He went on like he'd done it all his life.
What Hendrick and Petersen have done is create a world and a system within which computer gamers can adventure, rather than providing one quest to be solved.
For the first time, this writer really believes that people will continue to play this game after it is won.
The world is that palpable and that satisfying.
Victory, like John Sturges' The Great Escape and a number of jolly, post-World War II English films, is not meant to be taken too seriously.
It sees P.O.W. life as not much different from life in a rather severe boarding school for adult males.
The attached detailed report concerns the possibility of constructing a “super-bomb” which utilizes the energy stored in atomic nuclei as a source of energy.
The energy liberated in the explosion of such a super-bomb is about the same as that produced by the explosion of 1000 tons of dynamite.
This energy is liberated in a small volume, in which it will, for an instant, produce a temperature comparable to that in the interior of the sun.
The blast from such an explosion would destroy life in a wide area.
The size of this area is difficult to estimate, but it will probably cover the centre of a big city.
Thus the typical citizen drops down to a lower level of mental performance as soon as he enters the political field.
He argues and analyzes in a way which he would readily recognize as infantile within the sphere of his real interests.
When I passed the Chancellor he arose, waved his hand at me, and I waved back at him.
I think the writers showed bad taste in criticizing the man of the hour in Germany.
Hanna is good, sound filmmaking.
It depends on stylistic order and discipline, a clear story map and ingenious action sequences.
It is not all banging and flashing.
From what I personally saw, I do not hesitate to describe the crime as a massacre, a crime against humanity.
Nor do I hesitate to accuse the government security forces of responsibility.
The geographic location of the BMAC … conforms, it is argued, with the historical situation of the Da(h)a and Parnoi mentioned in Greek and Latin sources, which have, in turn, been identified with the Dasas, Dasyus, and Panis of the Rig Veda who were defeated by the Vedic Arya.
Most bands need to record multiple guitar tracks in the studio to achieve the kind of heaviness; The Acacia Strain deliver every time they step on stage.
If rum ifs the archetypal New World Drink—protean, varied, inconsistent—planter’s punch is its cocktail equivalent.
Try inventing one yourself.
Start with something basic—one of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak.
Then adapt it .
Try exotic fruit or maybe some bitters.
It doesn’t really matter what you do.
Planter’s Punch can be constantly reinvented.
It’s owned by whomever wants to claim it.
She in an manner invented a new kind of singing, by running divisions with a neatness and velocity which astonished all who heard her.

Well "Deathamphetamine" is the most personal thing I have ever written because it describes what I went through when I was addicted to Methamphetamine.
It was also written when Rick was still in the band as a last ditch attempt for him to read between the lines but it didn't have that effect.
The purpose of each reserve component is to provide trained units and qualified persons available for active duty in the armed forces, in time of war or national emergency, and at such other times as the national security may require, to fill the needs of the armed forces whenever more units and persons are needed than are in the regular components.
If you want to enjoy your flying with your wife and children, tour for five hours or so at 4 3/4 gal/hr in a heated cockpit, or go off and do aerobatics by yourself, it is hard to imagine an aeroplane in which you could do it more cheaply and comfortably.
Hi Ray. I think it’s sort of ironical that we ended up like this.
I asked for some leniency for my family.

It’s quite incredible how effective a game can be when one, often overlooked, aspect – the audio – is brought to the center.
The splashes as you walk through water, the growling and snoring monsters, bones cracking, knives slashing and the hideous laughter of Papa Sangre himself, all drag you deeper and deeper into the land of the dead.
Dear Dame Ethel, - Thank you for bullying me into going to hear that Mass.
The originality and beauty of the voice parts are as striking today as they were 30 years ago, and the rest will stand up in the biggest company.
Magnificent!
You are totally and diametrically wrong in imagining that you have suffered from a prejudice against feminine music.
On the contrary you have been almost extinguished by the dread of masculine music.
It was your music that cured me for ever of the old delusion that women could not do men's work in art and other things.
(That was years ago, when I knew nothing about you, and heard an overture – "The Wreckers" or something - in which you kicked a big orchestra all round the platform.)
But for you I might not have been able to tackle St Joan, who has floored every previous way playwright.
Your music is more masculine than Handel's. Your dear big brother,
President Roosevelt lost the Court-packing battle, but he won the war for control of the Supreme Court … not by any novel legislation, but by serving in office for more than twelve years, and appointing eight of the nine Justices of the Court.
Will he be able to enter the Commonwealth because some Custom house official, who can only put something before him in English, French and German, will make the test, and the highly educated coloured man will be able to beat him? … We know that the people of Australia object to the black man whether he is highly educated or not.
Even if he is the best linguist in the world we do not want him.
I know that I do not.
His racial disadvantages exist even if he is highly educated.

I was disheartened to learn that McNeish, Vincent, Holness and Stephenson had been denied the Polar Medal...of all the men in the party no-one more deserved recognition than the old carpenter....I would regard the withholding of the Polar Medal from McNeish as a grave injustice.
The overture is well known, and retains its favour among the most striking and agreeable of Handel’s instrumental productions Many of the Handel’s operas offer perhaps more specimens of his fire and learning, but none more pleasing melodies and agreeable effects In the next , Deh lasciati mi, the composer, in compliance with the taste of the times, adheres perhaps somewhat too closely to the text, almost every two bars being in nearly the same metre.
It is, however, original and totally different from all the other songs in the opera.
Remember the great words of Joe E. Lewis: He said you're not drunk as long as you can lay on the floor without holding on.
There are however some exceptions.
For instance, as Mr Giffen has pointed out, a rise in the price of bread makes so large a drain on the resources of the poorer labouring families and raises so much the marginal utility of money to them, that they are forced to curtail their consumption of meat and the more expensive farinaceous foods: and, bread being still the cheapest food which they can get and will take, they consume more, and not less of it.
But such cases are rare; when they are met with they must be treated separately.
Using the Holocaust in order to tarnish those who promote the theory of evolution is outrageous and trivializes the complex factors that led to the mass extermination of European Jewry.
In 1932 was celebrated throughout Germany the centenary of the immortal poet Goethe.
The Harz Goethe Centenary Committee (the Harzer Verkehrsverband), hearing that I possessed a copy of the ritual of the Bloksberg Tryst, invited me to reproduce the experiment as part of the Goethejahr celebrations.
I consented.
Another reason why I decided to go - quite unofficially - was that I wished to emphasise the absolute futility of ancient magical ritual under twentieth-century conditions.
Then he said we were experiencing strong head winds and we had to land in Canada to refuel.

While new tracks peal off some pleasant moments, songs flashing the group’s trademark lyrical wit generally tend toward musical vaporware, while those revealing an occasional glimmer of instrumental creativity go nowhere fast on the songwriting.
NOTE: Snowden's leak is basically done.
It's newspapers - not Snowden - deciding what gets disclosed and in what sequence.
This series is much more about how the psychology of the characters affects history than simply following the history as we know it.
There is a tendency in dramas about Rome to take a stiff, formal approach, which is certainly a valid way to treat the material, but we’re more interested in the living, breathing people.
To know that we were right there in the place where these things occurred was so powerful and emotional.
That feeling of dancing with ghosts — it’s palpable.
Jeff's solo at the end of 'You Shook Me' indeed lived up to his claim, vomiting all over Rod's shoes at the conclusion

In C++ it’s harder to shoot yourself in the foot, but when you do, you blow off your whole leg.
Looking against the sun doth induce sneezing.
The cause is not the heating of the nostrils, for then the holding up of the nostrils against the sun, though one wink, would do it; but the drawing down of the moisture of the brain; for it will make the eyes run with water: and the drawing of moisture to the eyes, doth draw it to the nostrils by motion of consent; and so followeth sneezing: as contrariwise, the tickling of the nostrils within, doth draw the moisture to the nostrils, and to the eyes by consent; for they also will water.
But yet it hath been observed, that if one be about to sneeze, the rubbing of the eyes till they run with water will prevent it.
Whereof the cause is, for that the humour which was descending to the nostrils, is diverted to the eyes.
Every little piece of plastic manufactured in the past 50 years that made it into the ocean is still out there somewhere.
Isn’t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?
reflects more disgrace on the public than composer.
10cc's sixth British single, and the opening cut on 1974's epochal Sheet Music album, the stridently riff-heavy Wall Street Shuffle, is one of the band's most distinctive numbers, and an early indication of the sheer strength of the Eric Stewart/Graham Gouldman songwriting team.
April 10, 1970: Spring is here and Leeds play Chelsea tomorrow and Ringo and John and George and Paul are alive and well and full of hope.
The world is still spinning and so are we and so are you.
When the spinning stops – that’ll be the time to worry.
Not before.
Until then, the Beatles are alive and well and the beat goes on, the beat goes on…
The Substance of Fire steers carefully away from sudsy psychologizing or pulsing melodrama.
As it watches Isaac begin to lose his grip and his high-minded obsessiveness turn painfully self-destructive, the film wonders what place there is left in the modern world for people like Isaac, with their impossibly high and rigid standards.
The gap dividing Isaac from his children is not a glib matter of the younger generation's embrace of sex, drugs and rock-and-roll, but of a profound shift in morality and in the hierarchy of values between generations and continents.
Aaron, Martin and Sarah are decent people, but the Holocaust hasn't scorched them directly.
Between Europe and America, between the absolutes of the Holocaust and the comfy maw of American consumer culture, exists a gulf that can't be breached.
The film belongs to Mr. Rifkin, whose voice and stiff carriage capture to perfection Isaac's Middle European accent and his mixture of fastidiousness and bristling pride. The film, to its credit, never tries to pluck your heartstrings.
As it follows the Geldharts around New York, they are figures in a meditative dialogue on human values that reaches no easy conclusions.
Only at the very end does The Substance of Fire, which opens today at Carnegie Hall Cinemas, succumb to a sentimentality that until then has been scrupulously avoided.
But this drippy little finale is so vague, and comes and goes so abruptly, that rather than spoiling the film, it merely leaves it hanging.
To publish a strictly limited list of good nonfiction, such as biography, history and works on contemporary affairs, and distinguished fiction with some claim to permanent importance rather than ephemeral popular interest.
Blood stood in pools on all sides; the walls of the huts were stained and the grass colored red.
Lying around were dead bodies of both sexes and all ages from the old man to the infant at the breast.
Some had their heads split in twain by axes, others beaten into jelly with clubs, others pierced or cut to pieces with bowie knives.
Some struck down as they mired; others had almost reached the water when overtaken and butchered.
Deontological theories deny that the right, the obligatory, and the morally good are wholly, whether directly or indirectly, a function of what is nonmorally good or what promotes the greatest balance of good over evil for self, one’s society, or the world as a whole.
They assert that there are other considerations that may make an action or rule right or obligatory besides the goodness or badness of its consequences — certain features of the act itself other than the value it brings into existence, for example, the fact that it keeps a promise, is just, or is commanded by God or the state.
All this was in the two plague years 1665 and 1666, for in those days I was in the prime of my age of invention, and minded mathematics and philosophy more than at any time since.
Reign in Blood, it's a dogma.
Slayer is a dogma.
Reign in Blood is really top of the tops, definitely one of the best extreme metal albums ever.
Not just thrash metal.
D. J. Fontana had introduced me to the power of the big beat.
Ringo convinced me just how powerful that rhythm could be.
Ringo’s beat was heard around the world and he drew the spotlight toward rock and roll drummer.
From his matched grip style to his pioneering use of staggered tom tom fills, his influence in rock drumming was as important and wide spread as Gene Krupa’s had been in jazz.
By propagating ideologically inspired amoral theories, business schools have actively freed their students from any sense of moral responsibility.
Buy a frond of fern, - Gathered where the Erskine leaps - Down the road to Lorne
I doubt operas will not survive longer than this winter, they are now at their last gasp. the subscription is expired and nobody will renew it.
The directors are all squabbling, and they have so many divisions among themselves that I wonder they have not broke up before. Senesino goes away next winter, and I believe Faustina, so you see harmony is almost out of fashion.
The whole thing is how strong you are and how much power you got and how fucking mean you are — that's what makes you rise in the mob.
Every day's a fucking struggle, because you don't know who's looking to knock you off, especially when you become a captain or boss.
Every day, somebody's looking to dispose of you and take your position.
You always got to be on your toes. Every fucking day is a scam day to keep your power and position.
I think all the other papers knew by 1974 that NME had become the best music paper in Britain.
We had most of the best writers and photographers, the best layouts, that sense of style of humour and a feeling of real adventure.
We also set out to beat Melody Maker on its strong suit: being the serious, responsible journal of record.
We did Looking Back and Consumer Guide features that beat the competition out of sight, and we did this not just to surpass our rivals but because we reckoned that rock had finished its first wind around 1969/70 and deserved to be treated as history, as a canon of work.
We wanted to see where we'd got to, sort out this huge amount of stuff that had poured out since the mid '60s.
Everyone on the paper was into this.
Hahn was, in truth, something rare: a woman deeply, almost domestically, at home in the world.
Driven by curiosity and energy, she went there and did that, and then wrote about it without fuss.
The labour that was mine, removing them out of that common state they were in, hath fixed my Property in them.
There is almost nothing occurring most of the time but unison melodies and very lengthy drone basses, which is all very Armenian.
It is also very modern indeed in its elegant simplicity and adamant modal integrity, being, in effect, as tight and strong in its way as a twelve-tone work of the Austrian type.
There is no harmony either, and the brilliance and excitement of parts of the piano concerto were due entirely to vigor of idea.
It really takes a sound musicality to invent a succession of stimulating ideas within the bounds of an unaltered mode and without shifting the home-tone.
He took his hand of his hip and punched the side of my face, nearly knocking me off the chair.
I grasped the table.
I knew there was more to come and I didn't want to be sent flying.
He pointed at the window in the far corner. He said he was going to throw me out.
Eddie Harris finally steps out as a singer in the first of a series of humorous hard-luck songs that would be the flagships of his next few LPs… Harris also fools with an electronic rhythm machine and electronic horn attachments that practically turn his sax into a synthesizer.
In any case, the thing he still does best here is ride a groove, the best of which is the extremely danceable "Get on Down", complete with Leon Thomas-like yodeling and a percussive vocal from the erstwhile sax master.
Popper’s ideas have failed to convince the majority of professional philosophers because his theory of conjectural knowledge does not even pretend to provide positively justified foundations of belief.
Nobody else does better, but they keep trying, like chemists still in search of the Philosopher’s Stone or physicists trying to build perpetual motion machines.
Intermarriage between whites and blacks is repulsive and averse to every sentiment of pure American spirit.
It is abhorrent and repugnant.
It is subversive to social peace.
It is destructive of moral supremacy, and ultimately this slavery to black beasts will bring this nation to a fatal conflict.
The term 'marketing' sure is a frustrating one for me at the moment.
What you are now starting to experience IS 'year zero.'
It's not some kind of gimmick to get you to buy a record -- it IS the art form … and we're just getting started.

It took a short time to realize that this task was monumental.
They lay bare the foundations of a man's thoughts with curious distinctness, and exhibit his mental anatomy with more vividness and truth than he would probably care to publish to the world.
Inspired by events where my brother, who is a prison guard, walks in on an inmate doing something ridiculous in his cell.
The prisoner won’t talk and gets into this dialogue via a notepad.
After documenting that he can no longer talk because the devil removed his tongue, my brother checks the cons mouth with his flashlight.
When he tells him that his tongue is definitely intact, the inmate replies with the cryptic message 'Pray for Eyes
We cannot form to ourselves a just idea of the taste of a pineapple, without having actually tasted it.
United we stand, divided we fall.
Environmental activists use the ‘big talk’ of science to create a simple but false paradigm.
Malaria specialists who protest this are generally ignored, or labelled as ‘sceptics’.
Today, humanity's problems are mounting.
I tried to understand, predict, interpret to others and to organize politically for the changes I was sure must come as the mass consumption joyride of Americans collided with global population/resource realities.
In 1964 I began my own self-education (there were few college courses then in these matters) concerning this needed transformation of our economy and technology.
At the same time, I began to express my active concern when I joined with some other worried citizens and mothers of small children in New York City to form an organization called Citizens for Clean Air.
I soon learned that if the air was to remain breathable and the environment life-sustaining for my infant daughter during her lifetime, I and other citizens would have to commit ourselves to a process of learning about the complex, interdependent, urban, industrial societies in which we lived and about the basic assumptions on which their technical and economic system were founded.
I also discovered in studying ecology, economics, corporate behavior, mass media and our sociopolicical system that many of the traditional assumptions about economic growth, recource exploitation and competition were literally killing us.
If there are post-Harry Potter children who don’t know or care about The Wizard Of Oz, they might be at sea with this story about a not-very-nice grownup in a magic land, but long-term Oz watchers will be enchanted and enthralled.
There’s even a musical number, albeit an abbreviated one.
The average audience member at a slam attempts to judge a poem's artistic worth not on literary or grammatical qualities, but rather in comparison to the general popular culture around them.
Armed only with the experience of what they as individual people are entertained by in other parts of their lives, they apply the same standards to judging performance poetry.
I love the Disney films, so I thought this could be the greatest Disney movie ever – only with our music.
That would be a lovely mix.
They didn’t want that, though, and luckily, it wasn’t my decision.
Looking back on the film, I do like it now.
It's a happy fluke.
When she was cast back in 1987, I just liked the sound of her voice.
She's also a great actress.
In general, people who make their living doing voices on cartoons aren't always great for us.
Most cartoons want things peppy and cartoony.
Yeardley is able to go through moments of great emotion and wring it for all she's worth.
… mad.
They completely got the wrong end of the stick.
They obviously hadn't read the lyrics.
They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists.
‘Area 51’, is not an Air Force designation, but the area referred to is part of the Air Force’s Nellis Complex.
The complex is used for testing technologies and systems, and training for operations critical to the effectiveness of U.S. military forces and the security of the United States.
One part of the complex is located near Groom dry lake.
Some specific activities and operations conducted on the Nellis Range, both past and present, remain classified and cannot be discussed publicly.

I have a very dear postwar friend in General Wolfgang Martini, a shy, modest, charming, and very perfect gentleman ...
His many claims on my affectionate respect include his failure to endear himself to Göring, from whom the qualities I have just tried to summarize may have concealed General Martini’s very high technical competence, wisdom, and resource.
That was the infamous moment of my life when Dazed and Confused fell into the loving arms and hands of Jimmy Page.
Banning the depiction of pornographic images of children, including computer-generated images, was overly broad and unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

Thank you for the 'Spirit' and the 'Opportunity.'
I am proud to support EIA.
Thanks to their brave and pioneering methods of undercover work to expose crimes against wildlife and the environment, they have made a great difference to the world in which we all live.
Even to put About a Girl on Bleach was a risk.
I was heavily into pop, I really liked R.E.M., and I was into all kinds of old ‘60s stuff.
But there was a lot of pressure within that social scene, the underground — like the kind of thing you get in high school.
And to put a jangly R.E.M. type of pop song on a grunge record, in that scene, was risky.
Any examination of night photographs taken during night bombing in June and July points to the following conclusions: # Of those aircraft recorded as attacking their target, only one in three got within 5 miles. # Over the French ports, the proportion was two in three; over Germany as a whole, the proportion was one in four; over the Ruhr it was only one in ten. # In the full moon, the proportion was two in five; in the new moon it was only one in fifteen. … # All these figures relate only to aircraft recorded as attacking the target; the proportion of the total sorties which reached within 5 miles is less than one-third. … The conclusion seems to follow that only about one-third of aircraft claiming to reach their target actually reached it.
For me, experimentation is not about the technology.
In an ever-changing technological landscape, where today’s platforms are not tomorrow’s platforms, the key seems to be that any one of these spaces can use a dose of humanity and art and culture.
Evoland is truly an unique experience.
It functions as a solid and well-made action-adventure/RPG.
More than that though, it serves as a history lesson and a beautifully written love letter to the genres it emulates.
For fans of RPGs and action-adventure games, there is little to no reason not to give Evoland a play through.
The only issue with the game is that is lives up to its short-story namesake and is over too soon, but it is satisfying up until its last moment.
WHEREAS, we issued our decree ordering the citizens of San Francisco and Oakland to appropriate funds for the survey of a suspension bridge from Oakland Point via Goat Island; also for a tunnel; and to ascertain which is the best project; and whereas the said citizens have hitherto neglected to notice our said decree; and whereas we are determined our authority shall be fully respected; now, therefore, we do hereby command the arrest by the army of both the Boards of City Fathers if they persist in neglecting our decrees.Given under our royal hand and seal at San Francisco, this 17th day of September, 1872.
Though it’s your brother stands on other side still it’s time to fullfill the orders to kill The beast thirsts for Aryan blood squeezing down his greedy claws With a stolen power he forces brothers to whet against each other By slyness the blood has been spilled pride has been forgotten and defamed But the memory still lives in our hearts What incited Germans to go against slavs who made Russia to rot Ukraine Who sucked power from the world like a vampire who feels himself a master today Towers have fallen but the persons do stand firm and the Mason’s pyramides do stare into our souls The taste of victory is bitterness and sarcasm It’s price was Shekel and their scourge upon our trampled backs Oh world beware new master this desert breed won’t die on their own If they weren’t burnt those 60 years ago they should be burnt today
Obviously, I'm very grateful to for reaching out to me and for that type of ability to represent my hometown, like, that was crazy.
So we went to the studio.
I went to the studio, and I fell in love from the jump
The uncredited guitarist who whipped out the fluttering, squealing solo on this ode to macho cowardice was Eddie Van Halen.
The aerodynamic metal flight pumped crossover fuel that would boost the success of ’Thriller’ — a gimmick Jackson would flog later with spots from Slash and Carlos Santana.
Without the Van Halen precedent, there might have been no collaboration of Run-DMC and Aerosmith on the 1986 rap/rock version of ’Walk This Way’.
L.I.E. is a well-acted and unsettling look at a boy’s relationship with a pedophile.

I wanted to work with Rihanna for a long time.
I’m very proud of her accomplishments ; especially since she was born on an island like me :).
This song is a female empowerment song.
But then again, its not specific to just women.
It speaks about flying, soaring high in the face of every single solitary adversity that comes your way.
I speak about how the media has attempted to box me in and how that has made me feel suffocated.
After years of being dragged thru the mud, I’ve mustered up the courage to re-define myself.
I believe that I represent an entire generation.
My fans have become my family ; and together we have become a movement.
Get ready for it.
We came to win. (… )
And we discovered, there weren’t 15 dead, there were 45. And they weren’t KLA soldiers, they were old men, they were boys, they were people from the village of Račak, who had been captured by the Serb army and the Serb police, taken away and executed.
So what happened here was a massacre of 45 villagers.

I think we had a lot to do with the population rush to California.

We have grossly underestimated mankind’s ability to find new reserves of petroleum, as well as our capacity to raise recovery rates and tap fields once thought inaccessible or impossible to produce.

Emacs started out as a text editor, which became a way of life for many users because they could do all their work on a computer while never exiting from Emacs, and ultimately it became a religion as well.
I'll tell you what I can't stand - insincerity, like someone mournfully singing about love without understanding anything about it.

Mbenga is nearly divided in two by the harbor of Sawau, which faces to the north, and is about two miles deep.
The entrance is narrow, being only a quarter of a mile from headland to headland, but it immediately opens out to a mile in width, and contains from four to ten fathoms of water.
There are several small villages lying around the harbor, each imbosomed in its pleasant grove of tropical fruit-trees.

In a great number of cases I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act — I understood that Dr. Oppenheimer acted — in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand.
I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated.
To this extent I feel that I would like to see the vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more.
In this very limited sense I would like to express a feeling that I would feel personally more secure if public matters would rest in other hands.
I made one great mistake in my life — when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification — the danger that the Germans would make them.

Design management is the effective deployment by line managers of the design resources available to an organization in the pursuance of its corporate objectives.

I am certainly not the first woman to suffer this kind of harassment and sadly, I won’t be the last.
But I’d just like to reiterate that this is not a trivial issue.
It can not and should not be brushed off by saying, , “trolls will be trolls” or “it’s to be expected on the internet”. These are serious threats of violence, harassment and slander across many online platforms meant to intimidate and silence.
And its not okay.

Today it is well recognized that earthworms are important agents for the maintenance of ‚healthy soils‘, and that they act as indicators of environmental quality.
The resurgence of interest in organic farming and ‚biological agriculture‘ (in which earthworms play a more important role influencing soil fertility) in recent years has brought Darwin's book and earthworms back into the limelight.
A great tube laid under the heath will, of course, act as a drain; and it is quite likely that the grass and gorse and trees on the Heath will suffer from the loss of moisture … Moreover, it seems to be established beyond question that the trains passing along these deep-laid tubes shake the earth to its surface, and the constant jar and quiver will probably have a serious effect upon the trees by loosening their roots.
In quantum mechanics, the process of measurement is a subtle interplay between extraction of information and disturbance of the state of the quantum system.
A quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement minimizes this disturbance by using a particular system-detector interaction that preserves the eigenstates of a suitable operator of the quantum system.
This leads to an ideal projective measurement.

We both came from backgrounds connected to music, and it was just really, really annoying for us to collaborate with people on music — I mean simple collaboration, just sending tracks to other people in a private setting, getting some feedback from them, and having a conversation about that piece of music.

Jazz has been unfairly slagged in some quarters as an inconsistent and unfocused record; granted, there’s a bit of filler cluttering the second half, Jazz emerges as one of Queen’s most playful, maniacally entertaining records.
There are a few Freddie Mercury piano ballads and unusually hopped-up metallic rockers, but about half of Jazz is given over to quirky lyrics and/or stylistic detours (which, oddly enough, don’t include any jazz, unless you count the music hall swing of ‚Dreamers Ball‘).
It’s difficult to discuss Jazz without referring to individual tracks one by one, since it can come off as a collection of moments, but its anything-goes diversity actually helps tie it together.
Plus, there’s a giddy sense of fun through most of the album, which helps make it Queen’s strongest since A Night at the Opera.

Finally, suppose that the numbers are fairly large, so that mating may be regarded as random, that the sexes are evenly distributed among the three varieties, and that all are equally fertile.
A little mathematics of the multiplication-table type is enough to show that in the next generation the numbers will be as (p+q) 2 :2(p+q)(q+r):(q+r) 2 , or as p 1 :2q 1 :r 1 , say.The interesting question is — in what circumstances will this distribution be the same as that in the generation before?
It is easy to see that the condition for this is q 2
Remember, that time is money.
He transcended race and class in his personal actions, through his warmth and through his willingness to listen and to empathize with others, … and he restored others’ faith in Africa and Africans.
I decided that I wanted to appear in a sex video.
I took the plunge, enjoyed it immensely and to my utter astonishment, Paula Meadows was born.
This new incarnation of me didn’t seem to resemble the earlier, rather timid version at all.
Adventurous and insatiable, she launched herself into a new career; exhibiting herself without any shame in glossy magazines, making more films and creating new paintings out of the torrent of erotic imagery that was unleashed.
I had already discovered my interest in the riding crop, the strap and the martinet, but now I found that I was not alone in my interest.
The battle of 20 November 1759 was the Trafalgar of this war, and the English fleets were now free to act against the colonies of France, and later of Spain, on a grander scale than ever before
Despite its sales, Brothers and Sisters is not quite a classic album (although it was their best for the next 17 years), especially in the wake of the four that had appeared previously, but it served as a template for some killer stage performances, and it proved that the band could survive the deaths of two key members.
I needed to do that for myself.
Is it a great record?
I'm not too sure.
But I love it.
Do I feel successful from it?
Absolutely
Our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain.
In victory, we shall not be vindictive.
We shall continue to seek help and change for homosexuals, whose sick and sad values belie the word ‘gay’ which they pathetically use to cover their unhappy lives.
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town, I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, But is there because he's a victim of the times.
A too-conventional cop show

I don't care.
The band's brilliant.
H----l would furnish us with Airs expressive of the Rage of Tyrants, the PAssions of Heroes, and the Distresses of Lovers in the Heroick Stile.
B----ni sooth us with fighing Shepherds, bleating Flocks, chirping Birds, and purling Streams in the Pastoral: And A----o give us good Dungeon Scenes, Marches for a Battel, or Minuets for a Ball, in the Miserere.
H----l would warm us in Frost or Snow, by rousing every Passion with Notes proper to the Subject: Whilst B----ni would fan us, in the Dog-Days, with an Italian Breeze, and lull us asleep with gentle Whispers.
Every marine must understand that the Marine Crops does guarantee equal rights, equal opportunity, and equal protections, without regard to race.
Features on the South American coast down to southern Brazil can be identified with certainty.
Beyond that, though, the map is fantasy.
It doesn’t match either South America or Antarctica very well.
Kenji Doihara was something else.
He was an able army officer with unusual ability in many directions.
There were many Japanese Leaders whose careers were much more dubious than Doihara’s, but they were fortunate enough not to become known to the Western press.
I finally put Doihara’s name on the war criminal list, because he had taken an aggressive part in the unwarranted attack on China in 1938.
Anyway, our people wanted to hang him.
So they did.
The Space Needle marks a point in history of the City of Seattle and represents American aspirations towards technological prowess. embodies in its form and construction the era’s belief in commerce, technology and progress.
To improve the lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of humanity
The mission of the Rhode Island School of Design, through its college and museum, is to educate its students and the public in the creation and appreciation of works of art and design, to discover and transmit knowledge and to make lasting contributions to a global society through critical thinking, scholarship and innovation.
How can we dance when our earth is turning How do we sleep while our beds are burning
But, to shorten the repeated summation of digits, it is expedient to construct a table, which must be engraved in the memory of the arithmetician.
In the end, Krazy Ivan is a good, solid game.
It's just a little too short.
This is obviously a bleak and anti-utopian philosophy that goes against practically everything Americans want to believe.
It contradicts the conventional wisdom of modern democratic society.
It also contradicts the neoconservatives' own declared policy ambitions to make the Muslim world democratic and establish a new U.S.-led international order, which are blatantly utopian.
Strauss’s thought is a matter of public interest because his followers are in charge of U.S. foreign policy.
But he is more interesting than they are.
One day, a piano arrived in our home and I took up residence at, on, and literally in it.
I only ventured out to roller skate to Ravel’s Bolero and to buy my first guitar with my pocket money when I was 11.
The weaknesses of Berenice are dramatic, not musical. There is no perceptible falling off in invention: almost every aria, even when tangential to the plot, has some subtle turn of phrase or structural detail.
Burney, for whom drama and characterisation held little interest, ranked it very high and devoted several pages to a description of the score.
Tlingit bears a close resemblance to Athapaskan-Eyak in phonolgy and grammatical structure, but shows little regular correspondence in vocabulary.
Therefore the nature of the relationship between Athapascan-Eyak and Tlingit remains an open question.
… I hated the song when we first started recording it – I was quite ready to drop it altogether.
Then we hit upon the hypnotic guitar chugs and it all came together.
The most dangerous phrase in the language is, 'We’ve always done it this way.'
There’s a black cloud of smoke coming up through the undercast at ... three-thirty, four o’clock position right now.
Looks like (an) oil or gasoline fire.
We foresee a brilliant future for the Weller car and its talented designer.
BUT - when it comes to bands like Crush Evil, we must take serious action.
It’s bad enough to have a couple of society bands, but a CHRISTIAN band is too much.
But don't worry, we have plans.
They will not continue for a very long time.
It is hard to bear.
But what makes it easier is the realization of the poisoned atmosphere in Germany.
That makes it easier because it’s actually no loss.
Where I am, there is Germany.
I carry my German culture in me.
I have contact with the world and I do not consider myself fallen.
The United States was deeply concerned to learn that the Government of Equatorial Guinea has executed four individuals after a summary military tribunal on August 21.
While we respect Equatorial Guinea’s right to defend its national security, the trial failed to meet minimum international human rights guarantees.
We are also disappointed in the 20 year jail sentences handed down by the same military tribunal to opposition party members Santiago Asumu Nguema and Marcelino Nguema Esono.
Both had previously been acquitted in a civilian court, and were tried a second time for the same offense by the military tribunal.
We call on the Government of Equatorial Guinea to commit to upholding the rights guaranteed by its own Constitution and its obligations under international human rights law.
We can fill the whole earth with geniuses, talented people, healthy people.
I suggest to create worldwide lobbies to help to understand genetic programs.
Man has reached to the moon but he has not made much effort to understand genetic programs.
The reasons are simple, because all the vested interests, all the religions are threatened; they know that once the program of the genes is understood, the old cannot exist any longer.
Much more emphasis should be how we can also change the program.
We are learning about health, diseases, age, coloring.
First we have to learn how to change the programs.
A man, for example, may have the mind of a Nobel Prize winner, but the body may be sick.
He may not be able to use the mind if the body cannot support it – unless we can change the program.
Once we know how to change the program, thousands of possibilities open up.
We can give every man and woman the best of everything.
There is no need for anyone to suffer unnecessarily.
Being retarded, crippled, blind, ugly – all these will be possible to change.
Criminals can be avoided -- politicians can be avoided, priests can be avoided, murderers can be avoided, rapists can be avoided, violent people can be avoided.
Or if they have some special quality in them, their genetic program can be changed.
Their violence can be taken out, rather than teaching people not to be violent, not to be thieves, not to be criminals.
They glanced at my hair and said ‘Yes, we want that funny haircut too’.
But when Vice Admiral Ōnishi summoned me to his deathbed and asked me to look after his affairs, and I saw him die with a smile on his face, I became convinced that in some circumstances a man can embrace death with joy.
I am not trying to give you a philosophy, a doctrine, a dogma.
A dogma has to be consistent, a creed has to be consistent.
I am not trying to convert you to a certain belief; a belief has to be consistent.
I am trying to give you a vision, not a belief.
I am trying to help you to come to my window to see the sky, to see the truth.
That truth cannot be described.
And that truth cannot be made a dogma, and that truth contains all contradictions – because it is so vast.
So I go on giving you glimpses, aspects of it: one aspect is contradictory to another aspect.
But in the whole truth, all aspects meet and mingle and are one.
The Rocky Mountain Institute is an entrepreneurial nonprofit organization that fosters the efficient and restorative use of natural, human and other capital to make the world more secure, just, prosperous, and life-sustaining.
We do this by inspiring business, civil society, and government to design integrative solutions that create true wealth.
offers little that its twin, the Jeff Beck Group, didn't say as well or better three months ago. may be as foppish as Rod Stewart, but he's nowhere near so exciting.
It would seem that, if they're to help fill the void created by the demise of Cream, they will have to find a producer (and editor) and some material worthy of their collective attention.
You’re thinking of Europe as Germany and France.
I don’t.
I think that’s old Europe.
I also apologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I had proven that reparative therapy works with some ‘highly motivated’ individuals
but a dispute taking place between the author and the manager, it was never acted, nor printed.
We've got some things that are hip-hop leaning, and we've got some things that are more pop/rock leaning.
It being obviously impossible for three British transport ships to anchor for an indefinite period in French inshore waters, it has been decided that if the Jews do not begin to disembark before 6 p.m. on 22nd August, the ships will sail to the British Zone in Germany, where the passengers will be immediately disembarked.
This is the only territory under British jurisdiction, excluding Cyprus and Palestine, in which such a large number of people may be adequately accommodated and cared for within a reasonable amount of time.
I reasoned that if I went to Auschwitz as a Jew rather than as a revisionist that I would have a better chance to cut through the misinformation and lies that so distort what really happened in the German camps during the war. ...
So, donning my yarmulke, and not letting anybody in Poland know where my sympathies were, I began my journey.
Even when we had problematic material related to the management of the war we restrained ourselves.
In a certain sense, we betrayed our role as journalists, but we did so because we took national, patriotic considerations into account and decided that in the event of war we were part of the Country; that it was permissible, and even required of us, to postpone disputes and criticism; and that we did not have to apologize, or to feel abashed, for our support and backing of the Army and the Government.
I had a responsibility towards him because he was under my jurisdiction as the manager of the club, and I gave him nothing
Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist.
Contrary to popular belief, I (Al Malnik) never worked for Meyer Lansky.
I knew him, and he was a good friend who I spent a lot of time with, but I never represented him in legal matters.
To me, Meyer was quite the grandfather type.
If you knew him and talked to him, you could never imagine that any of the stories you heard about him had any veracity.
You could never imagine that he was responsible for doing the things people said he did.
He was not a person to give in to rage.
An agent-centred restriction is, roughly, a restriction which it is at least sometimes impermissible to violate in circumstances where a violation would serve to minimize total overall violations of the very same restriction.
For how can it be rational to forbid the performance of a morally objectionable action that would have the effect of minimizing the total number of comparably objectionable actions that were performed and would have no other morally relevant consequences?
the 8-inch fuses failed so often that the battlefield was littered with unexploded 8-inch shells.
I said, "Look, turn the tape over and employ the echo for the brass on a spare track.
Then turn it back over and we'll get the echo preceding the signal."
The result was very interesting -- it made the track sound like it was going backwards.
Path of Exile has some unique problems of its own to sort out, as well.
Dungeons in the game are programmed to reset automatically following a very short period of inactivity; this causes headaches when, after clearing the first part of a lengthy, multi-level map, you die and have to fight through the entire bottom floor again.
I'm also not convinced that the game's current business model is sustainable.
These guys have gone out of their way to avoid typical microtransactions -- your bonus experience potions and the like -- but I worry that not enough players will care about vanity items to keep the business afloat.
I'd love to be proven wrong, though.
But is Path of Exile a better game than Diablo III?
I guess that depends on how you felt about Diablo.
Personally, I enjoy both games for very different reasons, but I can see how fans of Diablo II might prefer Exile over Blizzard's most recent effort.
The class holds the shared behavior for its instances (in the form of objects in a program list), 6. To eval a program list, control is passed to the first object and the remainder is treated as its message
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
As the member of the Interim Administration responsible for foreign affairs, I should like to inform the Council that, taking into account all relevant considerations, an international security force could be deployed under Chapters VI or VII of the Charter.
A ship in a harbor is safe, but that is not what a ship is built for.
It might be a Scottish name, taken from a story about two men in a train. One man says ‘What’s that package up there in the baggage rack?’, and the other answers ‘Oh, that’s a McGuffin’.
‘Well’, the other man says, ‘It’s an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands’. The first man says ‘But there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands’, and the other one answers ‘Well, then that’s no McGuffin!’.
It's funky, it's heavy, it's dark and sometimes, industrial-tinged.
Working with so many different people and everything, it's made it out to be a really well-rounded album of a lot of different things.
It's definitely Korn, it's definitely groove-oriented.
But it's our most experimental album to date.
We're very excited.
We're all sitting around, when we listen to it, looking at each other going, 'I can't believe that's us.' I think people are really going to dig it.
When compared to 30 ms frame size mode, this 15.2 kbps mode is characterized with: higher basic quality, higher packet loss robustness, lower complexity and algorithmic delay.

75 percent of ANP units in key terrain districts were rated as either “Effective with Advisors” or “Effective with Assistance,” although none were yet rated as independent.
In the ANA, 74 percent of battalion-sized units were now rated as “Effective with Advisors” or “Effective with Assistance,” (...)
In early 2010, the ANSF comprised just 30 percent of committed forces in Operation Moshtarak in Helmand Province; six months later, in Operation Hamkari in Kandahar Province, the ANSF comprised approximately 60 percent of overall forces.
His work is a study on the time period of World War II and the atrocities of war.
The scenes he creates, or recreates, are his emotional response to what he once viewed and are meant to evoke a similar response in others.
If the radiance of a thousand suns / were to burst at once into the sky / that would be like / the splendor of the Mighty One and I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds.
I think this may be termed a complete victory as none of the enemy escaped.
Yarbles!
Great bolshy yarblockos to you.

Bedways is rightways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right?
I beg to report that on the morning of the 30th Sept. last, my attention was called to some writing on the wall of the entrance to some dwellings at No. 108 Goulston Street, Whitechapel which consisted of the following words: "The Juews are the men that will not be blamed for nothing", and knowing in consequence of suspicion having fallen upon a Jew named 'John Pizer' alias 'Leather Apron' having committed a murder in Hanbury Street a short time previously, a strong feeling existed against the Jews generally, and as the Building upon which the writing was found was situated in the midst of a locality inhabited principally by that Sect, I was apprehensive that if the writing were left it would be the means of causing a riot and therefore considered it desirable that it should be removed having in view the fact that it was in such a position that it would have been rubbed by persons passing in & out of the Building.
There is not a law under which any part of this universe is governed which does not come into play, and is touched upon in these phenomena.
There is no better, there is no more open door by which you can enter into the study of natural philosophy.
Anatole Broyard wanted to be a writer – and not just a Negro writer consigned to the back of the literary bus.
Deus Ex was chosen for an Apple Design Award because of its compelling game play, fantastic graphics, and enormous environments that immerse the player in a fantastic sci-fi world.
Pushing OpenGL to the limits, Deus Ex leverages advanced shader techniques to deliver high-dynamic range lighting effects, and Open AL to deliver rich and complex audio soundscapes.
It is one of the newest and most impressive AAA games on the Mac App Store.
Charging a man with murder in this place is like handing out speeding-tickets at the Indy 500.
Clever, well-written and brightly directed ...
Buffy at its best.
That’s the dynamic of Documenta 12 as a whole. Does it work?
In the end, no.
The first time through, its combination of new names and forms generates an excitement of discovery.
It’s so great not to see everyone you’ve seen everywhere else.
On a return visit the surprise has diminished, and the installation starts to look too porous; the curatorial ideas too obvious, pedantic and confining; the work too small, private, underdone, done-before.
The reason is, as soon as you’re talking about dreams, the potential of the human mind is infinite.
And so the scale of the film has to feel infinite.
It has to feel like you could go absolutely anywhere by the end of the film.
Lars wanted me to play some guitar leads ...
So James and Lars brought the four-track over to my appartment and I did the solo on a little Montgomery Ward amp.
Mondrian is a light, thin man, half-bald with the sharp ascetic features of a catholic priest or scientist.
There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar trying to make up our rasoodocks what to do with the evening.

This would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.
There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.
The violence of sado-masochistic encounters involves the indulgence of cruelty by sadists and the degradation of victims.
Society is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence.
Pleasure derived from the infliction of pain is an evil thing.
Cruelty is uncivilised.
whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest.
The partizans for Bononcini seem to have had little foundation for their praise of his plaintive and pathetic songs; as there are generally more airs of that kind in a single act of an opera set by Handel, than in any one of Bononcini's whole dramas.
While its successor, the Sinclair Spectrum, got the nation playing computer games, the ZX81 was the tipping point that turned the home computer from nerd hobby into something anyone could buy and use.
The White electorate has reached out, through this landslide win for the YES vote, to all our compatriots, to all other South Africans and the message of this referendum is: Today, in a certain sense, is the real birthday of the new South African nation.
one of the most despicable characters I have ever met.
Working with Bob Rock has been the best experience that we have had in the studio.
Bob is obviously a great producer, but beyond that Bob and we get along and sort of see the record making process similarly..the songs sometimes take a little longer to finish but the end result is far better for taking the time and is something we're very proud of.
...they don't have a hand in day-to-day activities, just like Lee Iacocca is not on the production line at Chrysler.
Lack greatly influenced the course of ornithological studies and by his friendly and enthusiastic nature inspired many students to take up the study of birds.
Mensa’s purposes are to identify and foster human intelligence for the benefit of humanity; to encourage research in the nature, characteristics, and uses of intelligence; and to provide a stimulating intellectual and social environment for its members.
11 Bit Studios is trying to create something that leaves you with a lasting, emotional understanding of what warzone survival truly entails.
It’s ambitious, but so far the ideals aren’t let down by the execution: it is aiming for a very, very difficult balance, and at least in the preview, is hitting it dead on. he designers have built something in which it’s possible to survive, but only just …
It's a double live album that approaches the league of Ted Nugent's Double Live Gonzo!, the Who's Live at Leeds, and the Allman Brothers' At Fillmore East when it comes to representing a band perfectly.
The denial of any distinction between foreseen and intended consequences, as far as responsibility is concerned, was not made by Sidgwick in developing any one 'method of ethics'; he made this important move on behalf of everybody and just on its own account; and I think it plausible to suggest that this move on the part of Sidgwick explains the difference between old-fashioned Utilitarianism and the consequentialism, as I name it, which marks him and every English academic moral philosopher since him.
The hero at Oak Ridge was John Buford … he not only showed the rarest tenacity, but his personal capacity made his cavalry accomplish marvels, and rival infantry in their steadfastness … Glorious John Buford!
In a common hentai video, the viewer will notice a few things: larger than possible—even with plastic surgery—breasts on women (Bakunyū), whale-sized penises on males and transsexuals, tentacle projections used in erotic performance, incredible amounts of sperm often covering whole rooms, hermaphroditic characters with enlarged female and male parts (futanari), and/or Lolita/amateur characters (lolicon).
ELIZABETH FREEMAN, known by the name of MUMBET died Dec.
28th 1829. Her supposed age was 85 Years.
She was born a slave and remained a slave for nearly thirty years; She could neither read nor write, yet in her own sphere she had no superior or equal.
She neither wasted time nor property.
She never violated a trust, nor failed to perform a duty.
In every situation of domestic trial, she was the most efficient helper and the tenderest friend.
Good mother, farewell.
While Johnny Foreigner's manic enthusiasm gives their music an ADD quality at times, it also is what helps to make this delightfully cheeky disc such an exhilarating listening experience.
My stock was small, but modern and first-rate.
I had made no concessions.
The silks, the velvets, the linens, the knick-knacks and the wallpapers came from Martine, André Groult, and Iribe.
I had bought stuffs at Darmstadt, Munich and Vienna; Berlin and Florence supplied me with certain papers, Paris with new and amusing vases, pottery, porcelain, glass, and a few fine pieces of Negro art.
Let me say to the gentleman from Massachusetts that it is evident that we have at least two theories as to how the negro should be dealt with.
One may be termed his idea of the development by higher education, social equality, and the like, while the other might be dominated the Southern idea of the absolute segregation of the two races, the fitting the negro for that sphere and station which, based upon an experience born of more than a century's knowledge of him as a slave and nearly forty years' experience with him as a freedman, we believe he can acceptably and worthily fill, with absolute denial of social intercourse and with every restriction on his participation in political affairs and government that is permissible under the Federal Constitution. . . . The restriction of suffrage was the wisest statesmanship ever exhibited in that proud Commonwealth . . . .
Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move to the Internet as a platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform.
Above all, we are in need of a renewed Enlightenment, which will base itself on the proposition that the proper study of mankind is man, and woman.
The pursuit of unfettered scientific inquiry, and the availibility of new findings to masses of people by easy electronic means, will revolutionize our concepts of research and development. ‘Know yourself’, said the Greeks, gently suggesting the consolations of philosophy.
To clear the mind for this project, it has become necessary to know the enemy, and to prepare to fight it.
Bear left for a number of reasons, the main reason being his health.
On the last tour he did with us he had a lot of chest pain and felt really weak by tour's end.
He went to the hospital and found out his lungs were only working at a fraction of what they should have been.
His doctor told him that his only option was to stop screaming, which was actually the second time he had been told.
This time he thought it best to listen.
Ultravox were the link between punk and what came next.
a pattern of basic assumptions – invented, discovered, or developed by a given group as it learns to cope with its problems of external adaption and internal integration – that has worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems
But let old Charmers yield to new, Happy Soil, adieu, adieu.
We affirmed the reality of the mass murder of Jews during the Second World War.
We hired Lennie to write symphonic music for our game Outcast in 1997.
I was looking for someone who could handle all the music production aspects from composing to hiring the soloists and orchestra and organise recording sessions.
And the result was outstanding, way beyond my expectations.
I’m a film music lover, so I had strong references in my mind and all I can say is Lennie was up to the task.
The music was inspirational, the orchestration filled with rich articulations and great themes, the recording quality was top notch, and the most important thing, the music fit so well into the game’s universe.
Looking back at the game today makes me smile because the graphics look so dated.
But if there is one thing that still stands up against any of today’s next gen blockbusters, it is Lennie’s wonderful score.
that the greatest part of my Life has shew’d me to be a Patient Grisell by Nature, those songs that require fury and passion to express them, can never be performed by me acording (sic) to the intention of the Composer, and consequently must loose their Beauty.
Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government.
And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell.

Signiora Faustina, a famous Italian Lady, is coming over this Winter to rival Signiora Cuzzoni.
But we were determined to make the best COB album ever, so we were willing to do whatever it took.
Of course, having our producer Matt Hyde kicking our asses 24/7 definitely made the results even better, so obviously we're more than anxious to get this album out there.
With the advent of the ISS, there will exist for the first time a strong, identifiable market for “routine” transportation service to and from LEO, and that this will be only the first step in what will be a huge opportunity for truly commercial space enterprise.
We believe that when we engage the engine of competition, these services will be provided in a more cost-effective fashion than when the government has to do it.
We should not abandon our special relationship with the United States and Canada about the atomic bomb and we should aid the United States to guard this weapon as a sacred trust for the maintenance of peace.
He appreciated the good things in life and was a connoisseur of good food, fine wines and firm male flesh - all of which he enjoyed to the full in his long and distinguished life.
I had a lot of unfinished ideas, fragments of music I called ‘feels’. Each feel represented a mood or an emotion I’d felt, and I planned to fit them together like a mosaic.
they're like Metallica meets Incubus meets Linkin Park but heavier.
No DJing, no rapping, very melodic and the kids are just phenomenal musicians
If one of two objects is recognized and the other is not, then infer that the recognized object has the higher value with respect to the criterion.
With Evoland, we had to start over every time we worked on a new genre.
It was like developing several small games with just a bit of content in each, which is very time consuming.
So far no casualties and situation in hand …
This early date by the now celebrated Paolo Fresu Quintet from 1985 is revelatory in terms of how the band developed its lyrical interplay and tightly woven arrangements.
This was, and remains, an excellent debut.
The evidence currently available indicates that NH mean temperatures during medieval times (950-1100) were indeed warm in a 2-kyr context and even warmer in relation to the less sparse but still limited evidence of widespread average cool conditions in the 17th century (… ).
However, the evidence is not sufficient to support a conclusion that hemispheric mean temperatures were as warm, or the extent of warm regions as expansive, as those in the 20th century as a whole, during any period in medieval times (… ).
The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with the other states.
Alex died quickly.
He had a sudden, unexpected event associated with arteriosclerosis (“hardening of the arteries”).
It was either a fatal arrhythmia, heart attack or stroke, which caused him to die suddenly with no suffering.
There was no way to predict his demise.
All of his tests, including his cholesterol level and asper levels, came back normal earlier that week.
His death could not be connected to his current diet or his age; our veterinarian said that she has seen similar events in young (less than 10 year old) birds on healthy diets.
Most likely, genetics or the same kind of low-level (impossible to detect in birds as yet) inflammatory disease that is related to heart disease in humans was responsible.
yet the Fund for maintaining Opera’s being exhausted, they ceased of course, and the Singers left England.
War means fighting.
The business of the soldier is to fight.
Armies are not called out to dig trenches, to throw up breastworks, to live in camps, but to find the enemy and strike him; to invade his country, and do him all possible damage in the shortest possible time.
This will involve great destruction of life and property while it lasts; but such a war will of necessity be of brief continuance, and so would be an economy of life and property in the end.
To move swiftly, strike vigorously, and secure all the fruits of victory, is the secret of successful war.
Here the principal role, that of Bajazet, is given to a tenor, This is the first great tenor role in opera.
Handel was entirely successful in portraying Bajazet
Cézanne’s series of paintings The Card Players is the cornerstone of his work between 1890 and 1895, and the prelude to the explosive creative achievement of his last years.
Unfortunately for Meat, the nature of the music works to sabotage him, turning his powerful voice into another instrument fighting to be heard through the wall of noise.
He was an overpowering presence on the two Bat albums that dominated the charts, while here he sounds like another actor in an ensemble cast.
Orthmann leading the charge, the West German leading the charge now, Orthmann who has got finishing speed.
This really is pulsating, Orthmann from West Germany.
Hans-Jürgen Orthmann, the twenty-five year old who beat us indoor track und who is now closing the gap.
And there is 500 metres to go.
Can't remember West Germany ever winning in the International Race And it is a tremendous finishing pace.
And Virgin is closing too.
This is a magnificent finish.
This could be the closest title.

Within the three minutes and thirty-five seconds of ‘Good Vibrations’, Brian explains, there were a lot of riff changes.
It had a lot of movements … changes, changes, changes.
Building harmonies here, drop this voice out, this comes in, bring the echo chamber in, do this, put the Theremin there, bring the cello up a little louder here … a series of intricate harmonies and mood changes … I mean it was a real production. The biggest production of our life.
homosexuals should be given different localities.
They can live in their own world, in their own way, and be happy, but they should not be allowed to move in the wider society, spreading all kinds of dangerous viruses.
Life was simple before World War II. After that, we had systems.
The look in their eyes was like the life was sucked out of them.
After I lost my first friend, I felt it was best to be detached.
That is a mighty nice letter you sent me.
I am delighted to know the fine work you are doing for the cause of cripples all over the United States.
I have no need to tell you of my great interest in this work.
I've noticed you around / I find you very attractive / Would you go to bed with me?
Paper on which there are quotations or commentaries from Five Classics or the names of sages, I dare not use for toilet purposes.
And then we have this, which is perhaps the first work to perfect black metal’s most staple, and most important innovation: the ability to imbue rough and ready rock music with a sense .
Thus, the importance of Det Som Engange Var: neither the tongue-in-cheek rock and roll of Venom, or the grandeur of Bathory.
This is a new attitude to black metal.
The movie is not about Vietnam.
It is Vietnam.
We were in the jungle.
There were too many of us.
We had access to too much money, too much equipment – and little by little, we went insane.
It’s crazy really, because when you think about a new Beatles record, it is impossible, because John is not around.
So, I invented a little scenario; he’s gone away on holiday and he’s just rung us up and he says, just finish this track for us, will you?
I’m sending the cassette – I trust you.‘
… after dinner, the weather being warm, we went into the garden, & drank thea (tea) under the shade of some appletrees, only he, & myself. amidst other discourse, he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. «why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground,» thought he to him self: occasion'd by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a contemplative mood: «why should it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the earths centre? assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws it… »
The Blenheim is a consummate long-distance express for the wealthy enthusiast who wants to be a little bit different.
Would you be shocked, if I put on something more comfortable?
SSI had tried something similar with its Dungeon Hack game and editor back in 1993, which tried to marry the venerable old mainframe classic with its Eye of the Beholder engine.
Again, one has to wonder why so many developers seem to miss the point that it's precisely the lack of distracting graphics and complex interfaces that make the classic Rogue games so novel and playable.
It's a shame it didn't come out with the first round of Chess Boxes, but it was worth the wait.
I felt really kind of inspired – or maybe, in a way, jealous at the time – of the core tenets of their level design, with the crazy abstract spheroid playspaces, and the arbitrary gravity.
It was a really cool, interesting, original idea that supported classic platformer gameplay in a new way, but also they took full advantage of the core premise, and kept pushing the possibilities further and further.
The central ideas really gave the designers a ton of freedom, and they didn’t take that for granted, which was awesome to see.
He was a hunter and wanderer.
He became a friend of Bilbo.
He knew Gandalf.
He was intrigued by Bilbo’s story, and found Gollum.
When Gandalf went off on the last perilous quest – really to find out about Black Riders and whether the Dark Lord would attack the Shire – he arranged with Trotter to go towards the Shire and keep a lookout on the road from East.
He gives Aragorn a letter to Frodo.
Aragorn pretends he is a Ranger and hangs about Bree.
Last Night the new Opera of Faramondo was perform'd at the King's Theatre to a splendid Audience, and met with general Applause.
It being the first Time of Mr Handel's Appearance this Season, he was honour'd with extraordinary and repeated Signs of Approbation.
He gets better all the time.
He was galloping today.
He could have beaten his own track record if we’d tried.
We see it as Entombed music, if people see that as death ’n’ roll so be it.
We just laugh, death ’n’ roll, why not?
When we write songs, we aren’t thinking it has to be a particular style.
This is the first time I’ve ever heard of a guy being convicted of his own murder.
To me, it’s just metal and that’s it.
It’s not black metal, it’s not death metal, it’s not thrash.
It’s like, what the fuck?
We don’t spend too much time thinking about labels.
They don’t mean shit anyways.
For me, metal is metal, music is music.
So I don’t really care about labels.
But, you know, if somebody says we’re black metal or they say that we’re thrash metal, I’m ok with it.
I don’t really care as long as they don’t call it power metal.
It sounded like it came out of a 350-pound biker rather than skinny little Layne.
I considered his voice to be my voice?
Here was the central group of laboratories, and all it amounted to was a little underground cave, a wing of a small textile factory, a few rooms in an old brewery.
I believe that if we had and would keep our dirty, bloody, dollar-crooked fingers out of the business of these nations so full of depressed, exploited people, they will arrive at a solution of their own.
That they design and want.
That they fight and work for and not the American style, which they don't want.
Not one crammed down their throats by the Americans.
Lynda Carter, 'Wonder Woman,' had four nude scenes in the first 33 minutes.
I wondered, if Lynda Carter did nude scenes before she was famous, who else had done them?
I've been on a quest ever since.
The sounds were real horrorshow. … A young devotchka … was being given the old in-out, in-out first by one malchick, then another, then another… When it came to the sixth or seventh malchick, leering and smecking and then going into it, I began to feel really sick.
But I could not shut my glazzies.
And even if I tried to move my glazz-balls about, I still could not get out of the line of fire of this picture.
I beg your pardon, gentlemen; I am very glad to have in my Cabinet such able statesmen as you have proved yourselves to be.
And I shall be pleased to avail myself of your counsel and advice.
But I can never consent to being dictated to as to what I shall or shall not do. I, as President, shall be responsible for my administration.
I hope to have your hearty co-operation in carrying out its measures.
So long as you see fit to do this, I shall be glad to have you with me.
When you think otherwise, your resignations will be accepted.
We are all very much aware of our past and keep good relationship with our past, family is very important and I think it shows in our music.
We all know a lot about our past and hopefully we can pass the torch which our forefathers held a loft in the past.
We have much respect for our history and past.

I went to the Opera Sosarmis, made by Hendel, which takes with the town, and that justly, for it is one of the best I ever heard.
I have been born with four dispositions well adapted for making progress in science, but with two great defects in the faculties necessary for that purpose.
1. An ardent desire to know the truth; 2.
Great activity of mind; 3.
An uncommon (justesse) soundness of understanding; 4.
A strong desire for precision and distinctness of ideas; 5.
An excessive weakness of memory; 6.
A great incapacity of continued attention.
I explained it would take three days at least to get the basics.
He was a good student.
It’s a difficult style that requires perseverance.
When John had it down, he was so pleased to find a whole new way of songwriting emerge.
That’s what happens to a natural songwriter when you get a new set of performing skills.
Everyone always says this was written about Marianne but I don’t think it was; that was all well over by then.
But I was definitely very inside this piece emotionally.
The best moments arise when you stop to let it all sink in.
It asks for attention rather than reflexes, and serves as a reminder that so few of these experiences exist.
FEMALE VOCALS???

This was a test of the advertisement-broadcasting-system.
In case of a real commercial you would have been advised to buy something.
I wanted artistic control in a vise grip, because I knew exactly what I wanted to do with these fellows.
In fact, I financed and completely recorded the first album before going to Atlantic.
It wasn't your typical story where you get an advance to make an album -- we arrived at Atlantic with tapes in hand.
Atlantic’s reaction was very positive -- I mean they signed us, didn't they?
Observers should reason as if they were a random sample from the set of all observers in their reference class.
‘We were shooting near Tallinn in the area around the small river Pirita with a half-functioning hydroelectric station,’ says Vladimir Sharun. ‘Up the river was a chemical plant and it poured out poisonous liquids downstream.
There is even this shot in Stalker: snow falling in the summer and white foam floating down the river.
In fact it was some horrible poison.
Many women in our crew got allergic reactions on their faces.
Tarkovsky died from cancer of the right bronchial tube.
And Tolya Solonitsyn too.
That it was all connected to the location shooting for Stalker became clear to me when Larissa Tarkovskaya died from the same illness in Paris… ’
I remember stories about my grandfather, Vahram Papazian, who ran the Decathlon in the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.
Grandpa would tell us how, suddenly, two lengths ahead of the nearest contender, it dawned on him that if he won, the Turkish flag would be raised.
So he stopped.
Orlando was the last opera in which Handel composed songs expressly for Senesino; but by a comparison of the songs intended for Senesino, after the opera of Porus, with those which Handel had composed for him previous to that period, there seems a manifest inferiority in design, invention, grace, elegance, and every captivating requisite.
I cried fraud at first, and if you have no use for catchy little anythings you'll agree, but I changed my mind.
Marcus Miller acquits himself in the Gil Evans role, George Duke gets off a nice lick, and Scritti Politti provides a snappier cover than Cyndi Lauper.
There walked into the room a chimpanzee, shaggy and grey about the muzzle, yet upright to his full five feet, and poised with natural majesty. He carried a scroll and walked to the young men.
‘Gentlemen,’ he said, ‘why does Pickering's Moon go about in reverse orbit? Gentlemen, there are nipples on your chests; do you give milk?
And what, pray tell, Gentlemen, is to be done about Heisenberg's Law?’ He paused.
‘SOMEBODY HAD TO PUT ALL OF THIS CONFUSION HERE!’ And with that he revealed his scroll.
It was a diagram, like a yin-yang with a pentagon on one side and an apple on the other.
And then he exploded and the two lost consciousness.

It was a known fact among the criminal underworld that dealing with Al Malnik was the same as dealing with Meyer Lansky...
Ali is not homophobic, macho, aggressive or anti-social.

We wish to state that, from our own knowledge, no historical grievance will rankle so long or be the cause of so much justified bitterness as the removal for any reason of a part of the heritage of any nation even if that heritage may be interpreted as a prize of war.
Afghanistan is not yet out of the woods.
The U.S. must remain committed to Afghanistan in order to make sure that terrorism is defeated completely, that Afghanistan gets a stability and economic function that would put it on its own feet.
Before that, it would be very, very unwise to think that it's OK to reduce attention to Afghanistan, and I would very strongly recommend that , and all of the government, stay committed and aware of the goings-on in Afghanistan, and commit to it the resources, both material and moral, needed so Afghanistan becomes a country standing on its own feet.
Forcible and illegal evictions continue unabated. rior to or during forced evictions, threats, intimidations, and physical violence are used by local authorities and private developers, sometimes in the presence of military and police forces.
Land rights are regularly violated with impunity by influential individuals, companies and government entities.
Owners are often compelled to accept paltry sums, despite evidence of legitimate tenure or land titles, or to move to alternative sites.
These sites are usually devoid of alternative housing, sanitation facilities and medical services, and are usually far from where residents worked, adding much to their survival costs.
Steve Jobs, the pioneer of the computer as a jail made cool, designed to sever fools from their freedom, has died.
As Chicago Mayor Harold Washington said of the corrupt former Mayor Daley, ‘I’m not glad he’s dead, but I’m glad he’s gone.’ Nobody deserves to have to die -- not Jobs, not Mr. Bill, not even people guilty of bigger evils than theirs.
But we all deserve the end of Jobs’ malign influence on people's computing.
Unfortunately, that influence continues despite his absence.
We can only hope his successors, as they attempt to carry on his legacy, will be less effective.
I prefer to focus on meaningful player choices.
An overarching storyline can be essentially linear, but the player can be offered critical choices at pre-defined points in that storyline.
(And by critical choices, I’m talking about choices that have visibly different consequences, or lead to branches in the story structure.)
That way, the design team maintains control over the number of possible outcomes and paths, while players understand that their choices matter, and result a distinctly different experience.
And *all* choices should have consequences, or they shouldn’t be offered at all.
For years the Kaiser has been instilling into his people reverence for the omnipotence of militarism, of which the holiest symbol is the German uniform.
The Hayek-Mises explanation of the business cycle is contradicted by the evidence.
It is, I believe, false.
To readers in London or New York, distant battles in strange places must have seemed unreal, and the Golden Age style of war reporting – where guns flash, cannons thunder, the struggle rages, the general is brave, the soldiers are gallant, and their bayonets make short work of the enemy – only added to the illusion that it was all a thrilling adventure story.
The hero is just about the only worthwhile member of society.
I'm not talking here about axe wielding warriors, but about people who take the tough path in life.
The man (or woman) who witnesses an injustice and fights against it.
The person who doesn't say: ‘Well, there's nothing I can do about it.’ The carers who sacrifice their independence to look after infirm relatives.
The volunteers who risk their lives by working in the world's trouble spots.
Acts of courage are always spiritually uplifting and inspirational.
Self preservation is natural to us, and constantly seeks to make cowards of us all.
Heroes remind us of what we can be if we find the courage.
We live in a society where there is no law in making money in the promulgation of ignorance or, in some cases, stupidity …
Several zany titles resulted until John Cleese came up with the last name Python and Eric Idle remembered a character he had met in a pub years before.
The stranger had been a dapper sort and every time he came into the pub he would ask the patrons, ‘Has Monty been in yet?’ Idle’s compatriots liked the name and so the troupe and the show became Monty Python’s Flying Circus.
I announce a secret event as tremendous and mysterious as any that has occurred in the spiritual history of the world.
I announce the inauguration of a Third Dispensation, the dispensation of the Holy Ghost on earth, and the visible advent thereof on earth in the form of a Young Boy of thirteen years old, naked perfect and unblemished.
The forthcoming Lok Sabha poll constitutes the most crucial election that the country has had since independence.
The choice before the electorate is clear.
It is a choice between freedom and slavery; between democracy and dictatorship; between abdicating the power of the people or asserting it; between the Gandhian path and the way that has led many nations down the precipice of dictatorship, instability, military adventure and national ruin.
EIA performs an extremely important role in investigating various abuses of the natural world.
I believe it deserves support from anyone concerned about the future of the living world.

I myself am totally anti-Christian, I hate everything about them and their blind faith, but people still follow with a passion.
I wish that some of the people on our side has so much passion for what they believe in.
My personal beliefs range from Satanik thought to N.S. Aryan spirituality.
Arab Muslims are fanatics who believe in a different god, who don't value human life as much as we do, they are intent on destroying us (the west) with their oil or with their terrorism; the men seek to abduct and brutally seduce our women; they are without family and reside in a primitive place (the desert) and behave like primitive beings.
The women are subservient — resembling black crows — or we see them portrayed as mute, somewhat exotic harem maidens.
I’m sorry that my actions hurt people and I’m sorry that it hurt the United States.
I understood what I was doing and the decision that I made.
I’m sorry for the unintended consequences of my actions … When I made these decisions I believed I was going to help people, not hurt people.
I can tell you, honestly, the movie is ten times better than I thought it would be.
But it’s not meant to compete with Transformers.
This is an art-house film and no band has really done this in a very long time.
So we’re hoping that we catch some people off guard and we’re also hoping that we do something that is very credible as far its artistic acumen goes.

Many people ask what are Beatles?
Why Beatles?
Ugh, Beatles, how did the name arrive?
So we will tell you.
It came in a vision – a man appeared on a flaming pie and said unto them ‘From this day on you are Beatles with an «A»’. ‘Thank you, Mister Man’, they said, thanking him.
He probably did more for and for other places than was effected by the combined efforts of scores of better men; and indeed, in many respects he was not a bad man, being as a rule straightforward as well as shrewd in his dealings, as famous for his acts of charity and open-handed liberality as for in enterprise, giving also frequent proofs of personal bravery.

From the moment I read Gone With The Wind, I was fascinated by the lovely wayward, tempestuous Scarlett.

»D« is dumbness, and despair, desertion-desertion of you from your friends, your friends from you, everyone from everyone. Isolation and loneliness … and hating and suspecting each other, »D« is finally death.
ven though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable.
Every sentence isn’t just crafted, it’s tortured over.
Every quote and joke, what Hempel tosses out comedian-style, is something funny or profound enough you’ll remember it for years.
The same way, I sense, Hempel has remembered it, held on to it, saved it for a place where it could really shine.
Scary jewelry metaphor, but her stories are studded and set with these compelling bits.
Chocolate chip cookies with no bland “cookie” matrix, just nothing but chips and chopped walnuts.
While the sovereign right of each country to regulate its telecom- munications is fully recognized, the provisions of the present Regulations supplement the International Telecommunication Convention, with a view to attaining the purposes of the International Telecommunication Union in promoting the development of telecommunication services and their most efficient operation while harmonizing the development of facilities for world- wide telecommunications.
Thereby hangs a tale about this song.
Lyrics were written for it, but they were poor.
I mean, they were good, but one couldn’t publish them at that time.
Of course, we failed to publish it at that time, and we, Arkady Ostrovsky and I, decided to make it a vocalise.
But the essence remained in the title.
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value: # Individuals and interactions over processes and tools # Working software over comprehensive documentation # Customer collaboration over contract negotiation # Responding to change over following a plan That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
‘Liberty enlightening the world’, indeed!
The expression makes us sick.
This government is a howling farce.
It can not or rather does not protect its citizens within its own borders.
Shove the Bartholdi statue, torch and all, into the ocean until the ‘liberty’ of this country is such as to make it possible for an inoffensive and industrious colored man to earn a respectable living for himself and family, without being ‘ku-kluxed’, perhaps murdered, his daughter and wife outraged, and his property destroyed.
The idea of the ‘liberty’ of this country ‘enlightening the world’, or even Patagonia, is ridiculous in the extreme.
A managed democracy is a wonderful thing ... for the managers ... and its greatest strength is a 'free press' when 'free' is defined as 'responsible' and the managers define what is 'irresponsible'.
In the 21st century the technology revolution will move into the everyday, the small and the invisible.
The United States would only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners.
The entrance to this river is very narrow and very dangerous, for the ship has to pass between two rocks, where the current of the tide is tossed from the one side to the other, flashing between them as swift as an arrow.
The song’s about your first love or thinking you're falling in love, so it’s just kind of a really happy, sweet song.
I did write it about a guy, and I’m afraid he might have heard it and he’s going to figure it out!
Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.
Anger is what started me writing.
Writing, for me, then, is an act of defiance born of the need to survive.
I am me.
I exist.
I am Dakotah.

It is the quintessential act of optimism born of frustration.
It is an act of courage, I think. And, in the end, as Simon Ortiz says, it is an act that defies oppression.
You should always keep one principle in mind: Emacs does many things well, but it isn’t important for that reason.
Emacs is important, because of the integration of different things you need to do.

Without that I would not have been so screwed up as I am, and therefore not as creative.
The culture concept has been borrowed from anthropology, where there is no consensus on its meaning.
It should be no surprise that there is also a variety in its application to organization studies.
Naturally there’s still plenty of quirkiness to be found in the score, but with exhilarating pieces like 'Gusty Garden Galaxy' that make the listener feel happy simply to be alive and the beautifully moving end credits, this is a perfect example of how video games are producing some of the most exciting new music of any medium these days.
It is a tremendous victory in the effort to crush the Mafia
The first time I heard it I thought it was awful, and then the second time, ahem, I fixed the record player a bit and it sounded better.
I enjoyed a couple like ‘My Dog It’s Got Three Legs’ or something, and the intro to ‘Uncle Albert.’ … In general I think the other album he did was better in a way.
At least there were some songs on it.
My fellow Americans, I’m pleased to tell you that today I signed legislation that will allow student religious groups to begin enjoying a right they’ve too long been denied – the freedom to meet in public high schools during nonschool hours, just as other student groups are allowed to do.

You can take the title quite literally.
My fear is that the current generation of kids who're being born into this information revolution, growing up with the Internet, cell phones, iPods, this download culture, 'American Idol,' reality TV, prescription drugs, PlayStations — all of these things kind of distract people from what's important about life, which is to develop a sense of curiosity about what's out there.
I really didn’t think that a lot of the songs were worth of release, and I told them so.
I said ‘I don’t want a double-album.
I think you ought to cut out some of these, concentrate on the really good ones and have yourself a really super album.
Let’s whittle them down to 14 or 16 titles and concentrate on those.‘
Once again entertainment is used to get people's minds off hard times with comic ways of getting money, music, and dance that includes lots of pretty women.

Mr. Gates has for many years been closely associated with my personal affairs.
He has been through strenuous times with me, and has taken cares of many kinds off my shoulders, leaving me more time to play golf, plan roads, move trees, and follow other congenial occupations.

It would be unfair to tell students that there is a serious dispute going on among scientists whether evolution took place.
There isn't.
A lot of the time the creationists... they'll search through scientific journals and try to pull out something they think demonstrates evolution doesn’t work and there is a kind of interesting rationale behind it.
Their theology is such that if one thing is wrong with the Bible you have to throw it all out so that’s why Genesis has to be interpreted literally.
They look at science the same way.
If one little piece of the evolutionary puzzle doesn’t fit the whole thing has to go.
That’s not the way science is done.
Pemaquid Point Light is the delight of artists, photographers, and tourists.

The game should never be played with so many players running around the field confused. Our players did not even know which direction to attack: our goal or their goal.

In football, you are supposed to score against the opponents to win, not for them.
Erected by public subscription to the memory of George Henry Smith (skipper) and William Richard Legget (third hand), of the ill-fated trawler CRANE, who lost their lives in the North Sea by the action of the Russian Baltic Fleet, October 22, 1904, and Walter Whelpton, skipper of the trawler MINO, who died through shock, May 1905.
Bart is a really good kid.
He's just mischievous.
He's not bad, like characters who followed him such as ] (South Park) or Beavis and Butthead.
Bart can do some nasty things, but they seem so tame, by today's standards.
What was shocking 19 years ago, when the show started, isn't the least bit shocking today.
Bart hasn't changed.
I do question the sincerity and nonviolent intentions of some civil rights leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., James L. Farmer, Jr., and others, who are known to have left wing associations.
For my part, I travel not to go anywhere, but to go.

Reign in Blood was the one album for everybody.
Every song was an exciting song, and they definitely captured the essence of everything that thrash was about.

I was waiting for him in his house, and I saw the phone book was on the piano with ‘You know the name, look up the number.’
That was like a logo, and I just changed it.
Indeed, peel away the radio-pleasing buoyancy which is the song's immediate calling card and Love Is the Drug is as grimly unrelenting as any past Roxy attack -- as taut as it is tight, as sordid as it is sensual.
Simple Minds, Gang of Four, Public Image Ltd., and the Human League can all trace at least a soupçon of their future funkiness to Love Is the Drug, as can Roxy themselves.
The contexture of this Drama is so very easy, that it wou'd be troubling the reader to give him a long argument to explain it.
Some imbicillities, and the temerity of Xerxes (such as his being deeply enamour'd with a plane tree, and the building a bridge over the Hellespont to unite Asia to Europe) are the basis of the story; the rest is fiction.
Elbow are the best in the business at making grown men cry.
It is obscene.
To think that the first contact human beings would have had with another world would have been to explode a nuclear bomb.
Had they gone ahead, we would never have had the romantic image of Neil Armstrong taking ‘one giant step for mankind’.
To tell us that Galileo had 'incommensurable' notion and then go on to describe them at length is totally incoherent.
You have a need for other people to like and admire you, and yet you tend to be critical of yourself.
While you have some personality weaknesses you are generally able to compensate for them.
You have considerable unused capacity that you have not turned to your advantage.
Disciplined and self-controlled on the outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure on the inside.
At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing.
You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations.
You also pride yourself as an independent thinker; and do not accept others’ statements without satisfactory proof.
But you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others.
At times you are extroverted, affable, and sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, and reserved.
Some of your aspirations tend to be rather unrealistic.
Snowden’s whistleblowing gives us the possibility to roll back a key part of what has amounted to an ‘executive coup’ against the US constitution.
Second, Red Alert 3 right now is running off of SAGE and the visuals you see are at a minimum on par with C&C 3.
It hurts to witness Mr. Neeson's and Mrs. McDormand's good acting constantly beeing sabotaged by one of the worst books and stage directs since Bad Boys 2.

John's fucking ego is too big.
I could be his underboss, but he couldn't be mine.
Look, he's got balls, he's got brains, he's got charisma.
If we can control him to stop the gambling and all of his flamboyant bullshit, he could be a good boss.
Sammy, I'll tell you what.
We'll give him a shot.
Let him be the boss.
If it don't work within a year, me and you, we'll kill him.
I'll become the boss, and you'll be my underboss, and we'll run the family right.
And you, Kay Thorndyke.
You and your mad ambition.
Catering to his conceit, dealing and double-dealing.
You were going to make a big man of him, weren’t you, Kay?
You couldn’t see that he was a big man.
But you killed him.
That won’t be Grant Matthews those people hear tonight.
It'll be a shadow, a ghost, a stooge mouthing words that aren’t yours, thoughts that aren’t your own thoughts.
You’ve killed Grant Matthews, and he’s a party to his own murder.
Well, I won’t be.
He wanted a cause, you’ve got one.
Cause of lies, fear, and corruption.
We have, in fact, in Titanosuchus a carnivore of a more carnassial type than the Machairodus or other Felines … It most probably found its prey in the huge contemporary Pareiosaurs, Oudenodonts, and Tapinocephalans of its South-African locality
RAF Bomber Command Campaign Diary October 1944 14/15 October 1944: Not only could Bomber Command dispatch more than 2,000 sorties to Duisburg in less than 24 hours, but there was still effort to spare for No 5 Group to attack Brunswick with 233 Lancasters and 7 Mosquitos.
The various diversions and fighter support operations laid on by Bomber Command were so successful that only 1 Lancaster was lost from this raid.
Bomber Command had attempted to destroy Brunswick 4 times so far in 1944 and No 5 Group finally achieved that aim on this night, using their own marking methods.
It was Brunswick’s worst raid of the war and the old centre was completely destroyed.
A local report says ‘the whole town, even the smaller districts, was particularly hard hit’.
It was estimated by the local officials that 1,000 bombers had carried out the raid.
It was just a cellar in a basement of a Coffee Bar where they sold frothy Coffee, but It was a breeding ground for Rock’n’rollers.
As the story lines play out over several decades, it can be a little hard to keep track of who is on which side of the battle for the English throne and who we’re supposed to be rooting for at any given moment.
But over all, „The Pillars of the Earth“ will go down painlessly for the fan of this sort of epic; while it’s predictable and never exactly sweeping, it’s certainly eventful, and the production values are above average.
Originally most of the skeleton was in the rock, and it was regarded by the farmers as the skeleton of a Bushman, but it is said to have been destroyed through fear that a Bushman skeleton in the rock might tend to weaken the religious belief of the rising generation.
One sees so many students abroad at all hours, that he presently begins to wonder if they ever have any working-hours.
Some of them have, some of them haven’t.
Each can choose for himself whether he will work or play; for German university life is a very free life; it seems to have no restraints.
The student does not live in the college buildings, but hires his own lodgings, in any locality he prefers, and he takes his meals when and where he pleases.
He goes to bed when it suits him, and does not get up at all unless he wants to.
He is not entered at the university for any particular length of time; so he is likely to change about.
He passes no examinations upon entering college.
He merely pays a trifling fee of five or ten dollars, receives a card entitling him to the privileges of the university, and that is the end of it.
He is now ready for business — or play, as he shall prefer.
If he elects to work, he finds a large list of lectures to choose from.
He selects the subjects which he will study, and enters his name for these studies; but he can skip attendance.
I should betray my duty, and injure the public security, if I did not persist in asserting that this is a clear case of murder, if the facts be proved to your satisfaction.
All killing whatever amounts to murder, unless justified by the law, or in self-defence.
In cases of some involuntary acts, or some sufficiently violent provocation, it becomes manslaughter.
Not one of these circumstances occur here.
The film is packed with hilarious, often poignant interviews with metal luminaries.
Then again you've got songs where I talk about killing somebody and I've yet to kill anybody, so I don't know how personal that is?
If you could only paint a single good picture in your lifetime, your life would be worthwhile.
I conclude that there are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
The first method is far more difficult.
The joke is not on Kazakhstan. I think the joke is on people who can believe that the Kazakhstan that I describe can exist.
I am here today because of one horse and one horse only.
Although I've had a few stakes horses before, they didn't compare with Kelso.
There is an old saying on the racetrack that 'a good horse is dangerous in anybody's hands.'
How true that is.
Of all the top trainers in the past that have had this honor, I may be a little bit prejudiced, but I don't think any one of them had their hands on a horse like Kelso.
Trevor was never intentionally cruel or any thing like that, but he could appear uncaring.
He did have a dark side.
We all have it.
If you have a light side, you must have a dark side too.
One goes with the other.
It's his light side that I always think about.
That was captivating.
It might be supposed that the conjunction of the age’s greatest opera composer with its most successful librettist, a master of language and a fine poet to boot, would have outstandingly fruitful results.
But while all three of their joint operas contain magnificent music, none ranks with Handel’s masterpieces of 1724–25 and 1734–35 (though Poro comes near it).
The divergence of temperament was too wide.
Metastastio, as befits a cleric, wrote with an edifying purpose.
As Caesarian poet at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor for half a century, he was to dictate rules of conduct and lay down standards for public and private life and maintenance of the status quo.
Already in his early librettos moral issues are liable to take precedence over human values.
He moves his characters like pieces on a chessboard, so that they run the risk of declining into abstractions.
In all this his approach was the antithesis of Handel’s.
It is no matter for surprise that after setting three of his librettos Handel abandoned him, just as his reputation was reaching its peak of popularity, for the wilder slopes of Ariosto’s world of magic and romance.
Our living is now very poor, nothing but corn-bread and poor beef — blue and tough — no vegetables no coffee, sugar, tea or even molasses…
IPsec was a great disappointment to us.

We hear, since Operas have been forbidden being performed at the Theatre in Covent Garden on the Wednesdays and Fridays in Lent, Mr. Handel is preparing Dryden’s Ode of Alexander’s Feast, the Oratorios of Esther and Deborah, with several new Concertos for the Organ and other Instruments; also an Entertainment of Musick, called II Trionfo del Tempo e della Verita, which Performances will be brought on the Stage and varied every Week.
Never surprise the user!
The Bugis are a high-spirited people: they will not bear ill-sage...They are fond of adventures, emigration, and capable of undertaking the most dangerous enterprises.
Painful scrutiny is required to make out the items in front of Nsala.
The object closest to him appears to be his daughter’s foot, lying on its side, severed end tipped towards the camera; the object furthest is Boali’s little hand, resting palm side down.
These tiny body parts explode the peaceful composition of the image and illustrate an uncanny inversion of the typical representation of the injury: rather than picture a child with missing limbs, here Nsala poses with the remains of his missing child. Missing is not really the right word – Boali is more than simply absent from the scene – but perhaps there are no words which could appropriately describe the devastating affect of her nonexistent presence.
Verdi prati, which was constantly encored during the whole run of Alcina, was, at first, sent back to HANDEL by Carestini, as unfit for him to sing; upon which he went, in a great rage, to his house, and in a way which few composers, except HANDEL, ever ventured to accost a first-singer, cries out: “You toc! don't I know better as your seluf, vaat is pest for you to sing?
If you vill not sing all de song vaat I give you, I will not pay you ein stiver.”

Saramago decided, with all his ferocious humour, that this man should be in competition with another version of himself.
In the dark spaces of his mind, Adam deals with an obsessive sexuality that cuts him off from intimacy and therefore any hope of true love.
In order to be able to return to his regular life, his narcissistic side turns against the object of his sexual desire and destroys it.
The most singular thing about it is that, if it be true, it will probably lead us to regard all kinds of energy as ultimately Kinetic.
included horns, for the first time in the theatre, in ‘Alzo al volo’.
Even without the greatest Italian singers, Handel had proved that his music could draw; spirits were high, and opera might even yet prove profitable
This song is very simple.
Most of the time we have more chords in a song, because we find it hard writing a great song on just one chord.
But if you do it right, you can make it work, and this song is an example.
The United States will continue to strengthen conventional capabilities and reduce the role of nuclear weapons in deterring non-nuclear attacks, with the objective of making deterrence of nuclear attack on the United States or our allies and partners the sole purpose of U.S. nuclear weapons.

Weakling always had a couple sentences here and there, generally one per section.

I could be singing about killing Jews, or killing niggers, or killing whitey, or killing corporate America... it’d be equally valid or invalid.
My point has nothing to do with propaganda.
The division of labor and resources by sex constitutes a system of SEXISM, which is the oldest form of institutionalized oppression. To destroy sexism, we must fight, as females, collectively for the unity of humankind.

The church is very fine, but some things appear badly done the difficulty will be to keep up so large a building – the parish hard set to support four priests and a bishop.
People are coming back and almost adopting it as their own anthem, and it’s hard, I think, to write an anthem that's not cheesy, and I hope that this could be something in that category.
I hope this could be one of those things where it’s like, ‘Yeah, I want to put my fist up and feel proud and feel strong’.
But I also don’t want to be cheesy, it’s a fine line, and I think ‘Firework’ … would be like the opus or my one song — if I had to pick a song to play — ’cause it has a great beat.
But it also has a fantastic message.

On Tuesday last Signor Dominico Annibali, the celebrated Italian Singer lately arriv'd from Dresden, to perform in Mr. Handel's Opera in Coven-Garden, was sent for to Kensington, and had the Honour to sing several Songs before her Majesty and the Princesses, who express’d the highest Satisfaction at his Performance.

We wanted people to just read out "The return..." - as in a second album or a follow-up - and then flip the album over to look for a tracking list.
Not finding one, what they got was this apocalyptic poem with the song titles woven into it.

When ‘Broken Hearts Club’ was out, people would come from the movie to the restaurant for dessert and see me and do a double take.

did a joint interview with William Burroughs for Crawdaddy magazine in the early Seventies, and we had a lengthy discussion on the hypnotic power of rock and how it paralleled the music of Arabic cultures.
This was an observation Burroughs had after hearing "Black Mountain Side", from our first album.
He then encouraged me to go to Morocco and investigate the music first hand, something Robert and I eventually did.

I used to have a lot of respect for McCain, but he realized after the dirty defeat that he suffered at the hands of George W. Bush in the South Carolina primary in the (2000) election that he can only get elected if he plays the Karl Rove tactic b.s. He’s doing it.

His skull sloped back so abruptly that he could hardly be said to have a have a forehead at all; his chin slanted off right into nothing.
His eyes were small and round with shallow, glazed, pale-yellow pupils, and they were set wide apart in his head, and they were unwinking and staring, like a fish’s eyes.
Also when Fishhead became a man grown his likeness to a fish increased, for the hair upon his face grew out into two tightly kinked slender pendants that drooped down either side of the mouth like the beards of a fish!
It handled better, in a piloting sense, than we had seen in any simulation.
It was crisper in terms of control inputs and selecting a new attitude in any axis and being able to hold that attitude.
It was just a better handling vehicle than we’d seen in the simulations.
Fifty-seven people died publicly by the hand of the executioner in the course of a few days; many disappeared, and were either murdered privately, or sent to prisons, no one knew where.
The bodies of those killed by the sword were hewn to pieces and scattered about the streets, being denied burial.
I was miserable, and almost driven to despair, at seeing my hunting dogs, twice let loose by the carelessness of my servants, bringing into the courtyard the head and arms of slaughtered men … the quantity of carrion, and the stench of it, brought down the hyaenas in hundreds from the neighbouring mountains; and, as few people in Gondar go out after dark, they enjoyed the streets to themselves, and seemed ready to dispute the possession of the city with the inhabitants.
The reality is we are fighting two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the F-22 has not performed a single mission in either theater.

I have listened to and read endless theories about why, or how, he could have crashed on such a 'simple' corner like Tamburello.
No-one other than Ayrton Senna and me know what it was like to drive that car, through that corner, in that race, on that day, on cold tyres.
He was identified with pushing to the limit and beyond.
He would often prefer to crash into his opponent rather than be defeated.
It was not the fault of anyone else that he kept his foot flat when he could have lifted.
We must stand by all our democratic allies.
And we must not break faith with those who are risking their lives—on every continent, from Afghanistan to Nicaragua—to defy Soviet-supported aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth.
Hello everybody out there using minix - I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.
This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready.
I’d like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).
I’ve currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.
This implies that I’ll get something practical within a few months, and I’d like to know what features most people would want.
Any suggestions are welcome, but I won’t promise I’ll implement them :-) Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi) PS.
Yes – it’s free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.
It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that’s all I have :-(.

As regards the reliability of the conclusions outlined above, it may be said that they are not based on direct experiments, since nobody has ever built a super-bomb yet, but they are mostly based on facts which, by recent research in nuclear physics, have been very safely established.
The only uncertainty concerns the critical size for the bomb.
We are fairly confident that the critical size is roughly a pound or so, but for this estimate we have to rely on certain theoretical ideas which have not ‘been positively confirmed.

Each fork of Atlantic Creek, just after entering the meadow, divides as if to flow around an island; but the stream toward the meadow, instead of returning toward the portion of which it had parted, continued its westernly course across the meadow.
Just before reaching the western border the two streams unite, and then pour their combined waters into Pacific Creek.

… this momentous question, like a fire bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror.
I considered it at once as the knell of the Union.
Drinks may be offered at ten o'clock in the morning, for example.
What are we celebrating?
During the midday meal, wine is served.
What fun!
What are we celebrating?
The bars are open all afternoon, and people seem to be drinking.
What a riot!
What are we celebrating?
Pastis is served at six o'clock.
Whoopee!
These people certainly know how to celebrate.
More wine is served with dinner.
Toonstruck is such a well-crafted game it's hard not to enjoy yourself.
The voice work is excellent and the story is amusing enough to get you through the slow parts.
In the end, though, it's the puzzles that make the game so great, and finishing Toonstruck only made me wish there was a sequel looming on the horizon.
Ceausescu, the old dictator, admired his own Dracula and he modelled himself on Vlad the Impaler.
Ironically, 513 years to the day after Prince Vlad was assassinated, Ceausescu was killed at Tirgoviste, in a military barracks right across from Vlad’s Palace.
If there is any justice, this book will become a classic of its kind … With seemingly effortless art, this man tells his stories with perfect timing.
Many more famous authors could work for a lifetime and not achieve more flawless literary control.
I think, the spider is a physical manifestation of his fear of female intimacy.
I think at this point in the film where he's able to achieve closeness with a woman, he freaks out and all of a sudden I turn into the symbol of his greatest fear.
none who saw him ever forgot him...Almost faultless in work...he was born with such knowledge of his craft that he never required training and went to his work naturally.
“The main idea was to play slow and loud as fuck.
We were all playing in fast bands so we wanted to play something very different, something new and challenging for us.”
As I said in the Manila Supreme Court that I have done with my all capacity, so I don't ashame in front of the gods for what I have done when I have died.
But if you say to me 'you do not have any ability to command the Japanese Army' I should say nothing for it, because it is my own nature.
Now, our war criminal trial going on in Manila Supreme Court, so I wish to be justify under your kindness and right.
I know that all your American and American military affairs always has tolerant and rightful judgement.
When I have been investigated in Manila court I have had a good treatment, kindful attitude from your good natured officers who all the time protect me.
I never forget for what they have done for me even if I had died.
I don't blame my executioner.
I'll pray the gods bless them.
Please send my thankful word to Col. Clarke and Lt. Col. Feldhaus, Lt. Col. Hendrix, Maj. Guy, Capt. Sandburg, Capt. Reel, at Manila court, and Col. Arnard.
I thank you.
From the Dawn of Time we came, moving silently down through the centuries, living many secret lives, struggling to reach the Time of the Gathering, when the few who remain will battle to the last.
No one has ever known we were among you, until now.
"Dauði Baldrs" was what I could do from a prison cell, and "Hliðskjálf" too, but they were all music that I liked.
If they can't find anyone else to push the button, I will
The Hayek-Mises explanation of the business cycle is contradicted by the evidence.
It is, I believe, false.
Hi, we're blink-182.
This past week there've been a lot of questions about the current status of the band, and we wanted you to hear it straight from us.
To put it simply, we're back.
We mean, really back.
Picking up where we left off and then some.
In the studio writing and recording a new album.
Preparing to tour the world yet again.
Friendships reformed.
17 years deep in our legacy.
Summer 2009.
Thanks and get ready…
People have said, quite rightly, that Mostly Harmless is a very bleak book.
And it was a bleak book.
I would love to finish Hitchhiker on a slightly more upbeat note, so five seems to be a wrong kind of number, six is a better kind of number.
It seems but little than murder to give important commands to such men as Banks, Butler, …
the right thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right place.
I have seen Handel several times since I came hither; and think I never saw him so cool and well.
He is quite easy in his behaviour, and he has been pleasing himself in the purchase of several fine pictures; particularly a large Rembrant , which is indeed excellent.
We have scarce talk’d at all about musical subjects, though enough to find his performances will go off incomparably.
Operas are something mended within this fortnight; they are much fuller than they have been any time this winter.
Find him, bind him, tie him to a pole and break his fingers to splinters.
Drag him to a hole until he wakes up, naked, clawing at the ceiling of his grave.

Probably the most moon-like of the field areas.
Please don’t call me arrogant, but I’m European champion and I think I’m a special one.
Mr. Foo is a mysterious Second World War product, gifted with bitter omniscience and sarcasm.
It is the Undertones' Teenage Kicks, still, after 23 years, the record by which all others must be judged.
Maybe once a fortnight, after a few days of listening to sizzling new releases and worrying that the music is merging into angst but otherwise characterless soup, I play Teenage Kicks to remind myself exactly how a great record should sound.
Mr. Mews to be informed that the neighbourhood of Mount Eliza is reserved for public purposes
It is a program … for a united Canada, for one Canada, for Canada first, in every aspect of our political and public life, for the welfare of the average man and woman.
That is my approach to public affairs and has been throughout my life … A Canada, united from coast to coast, wherein there will be freedom for the individual, freedom of enterprise and where there will be a Government which, in all its actions, will remain the servant and not the master of the people.
Cell 211 is a thriller about a man’s attempt to save his life by thinking quickly. It never explains.
It simply sets out the situation and shows us what he does and what the results are.
You might be surprised by how much more exciting this is than conventional action.
The idea behind the Rhythm Kings was always that it should be a fluid group, allowing for different people to play together, both on record and on stage.
Really it just popped in my head one day and I just liked it.
It is certainly influenced/derived from Duck Duck Goose, but other than that there is no relation, e.g. a metaphor.
The general killed the Viet Cong; I killed the general with my camera.
Still photographs are the most powerful weapon in the world.
People believe them, but photographs do lie, even without manipulation.
They are only half-truths.
What the photograph didn’t say was, ‘What would you do if you were the general at that time and place on that hot day, and you caught the so-called bad guy after he blew away one, two or three American soldiers?’ General Loan was what you would call a real warrior, admired by his troops.
I’m not saying what he did was right, but you have to put yourself in his position.
The photograph also doesn’t say that the general devoted much of his time trying to get hospitals built in Vietnam for war casualties.
This picture really messed up his life.
The elimination of the Armenian population left the state an infrastructure of Armenian property, which was used for the progress of Turkish (settler) communities.
In other words: the construction of an étatist Turkish ‘national economy’ was unthinkable without the destruction and expropriation of Armenians.
I usually put the bass setting all the way up and the treble about midway up, depending on the condition of strings.
The older your strings are, the more treble you have to have, because the fidelity of the string really starts losing it after a while.
Bomber Command … made a heavy and concentrated attack on the industrial town of Brunswick, which is one of Germany’s biggest centres for the aircraft and engineering industries.
As the aircraft with the cameras runs up to the target the fires can be seen spreading rapidly all over the city and by the time the aircraft is over the target the whole city is ablaze and the streets can be seen clearly outlined.
Considering the importance of the contributions of Ivar Wickman, I do not believe that his work is fully appreciated today.
Fellowes’ tale effortlessly juggles a mind-boggling assortment of storylines – each practically worthy of a Jane Austen novel and absorbing in its own way.
The remarkable trick is that longings of the lord’s plain, overlooked daughter Edith (Laura Carmichael) and the chef’s harried assistant Daisy (Sophie McShera) are handled with equal care.
It’s facile to say the Brits excel at such productions, since this is the sort of material – especially in its period exploration of class distinctions – their Yank counterparts seldom tackle.
From virtually any angle, though, Downton Abbey is an almost peerless piece of real estate.
But no man is likely to profound the Ocean of that Doctrine, beyond that eminent example of industrious Learning, Kircherus.
… The problem was the increasing obviousness of the failure of Multics to deliver promptly any sort of usable system …
Can you imagine going to Disneyland without a camera to take pictures of all the characters?
When the Nazis came, they thought they were taking over for a thousand years.
They wanted to take pictures of the natives.
To get rid of that dejection of mind, which his repeated disappointments had brought on him
I waited a long time to hear you sing again, and I’m glad you decided to record.
I’m sure a whole lot of people will hear this album you and Billy Baughn made and will suddenly discover what I’ve known all the time – that you are not only behind the throne – you’re sitting on it.
Keep the audience in the hollow of your hand as your personal empire.
The way to belief is short and easy, the way to knowledge is long and hard.
Beauzée’s intellectual accomplishments showed a high degree of sophistication and gave expression to insights which have re-emerged in a clearer form as significant and lasting developments only within the present century.
The reason for their success is not just the information gathered, it is the way they use it as a political lobbying tool. One of Britain's most effective conservation groups.
Even apart from the instability due to speculation, there is the instability due to the characteristic of human nature that a large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism rather than mathematical expectations, whether moral or hedonistic or economic.
Most, probably, of our decisions to do something positive, the full consequences of which will be drawn out over many days to come, can only be taken as the result of animal spirits - a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities.
This opera, which was always performed by command of their Majesties, till the King went to Hanover, and then by command of her Majesty only, till the close of the season, July 2d, sustaining eighteen successive representations.
It was a street of whores.
There is, I always feel a subtle difference between an whore and a prostitute.
At least we used to think so.
Prozzies were younger, and more attractive.
Whores were debauched old bags.
It teemed with nasty characters - desperate, wicked, lecherous, razor-slashing hoodlums.
No Jews lived there. There were pubs every few yards.
Bawdy houses every few feet.
It was peopled by roaring drunken fighting-mad killers.
Lisp seems to be a lucky discovery of a local maximum in the space of programming languages.
‘Well’, you say, ‘it was a good one, and I got rid of the mathematics for awhile.
Maybe I could invent a better one’.
Maybe you can, because nobody knows the ultimate.
But up to today, from the time of Newton, no one has invented another theoretical description of the mathematical machinery behind this law which does not either say the same thing over again, or make the mathematics harder, or predict some wrong phenomena.
So there is no model of the theory of gravitation today, other than the mathematical form.
I wrote it in my head and once I got home and was able to get out of bed and get in motion I started demoing material and felt like I wanted to make a record.
It was very personal to me and I ended up getting in contact with Jesse because I don't think I'm the greatest vocalist and lyricist so I wanted a little help in that department.
We’re deeply sorry to inform you that Jimmie Strimell no longer will be a part of Dead By April.
The reason we had to make this decision is because of Jimmie’s personal problems With that said we also have some good news to announce.
We have found our replacement and we want to introduce you to Christoffer “Stoffe” Andersson, whom previously been performing as replacer in Sonic Syndicate and been in Markus’ other band By Night Stoffe is a firm member of the band and will obviously be a part of the live-shows to come and the record we’re currently recording.
The case is perfectly simple.
If we pass this bill which establishes a new and correct value for \pi, the author offers to our state without cost the use of his discovery and its free publication in our school text books, while everyone else must pay him a royalty.
I'm a dour bollocks.
I wouldn't be the life and soul of any party.
I'd be sitting in the corner.
So typical of Palmer’s eclectic nature, this album is a sloppy but very endearing hodgepodge of styles
It is therefore critical for me to state that I neither say nor believe that the virus was developed by white people or white powers in order to destroy the African people.
Such views are wicked and destructive.
Category VI protected areas conserve ecosystems and habitats together with associated cultural values and traditional natural resource management systems. They are generally large, with most of the area in a natural condition, where a proportion is under sustainable natural resource management and where low-level non-industrial use of natural resources compatible with nature conservation is seen as one of the main aims of the area .
It was like, “Oh yeah—we’re racists.
We’ve got a Cuban and a Chilean in the band.
Get real.”
The point-and-click adventure is dead.
No two ways about it.
It is no more.
However, long live the adventure.
As a genre the adventure is extremely healthy and probably has as much – if not more – potential than any other genre.
Simple doesn’t mean easy.
I can describe simple cooking thus: Cooking that is stripped all the way down to those procedures and those ingredients indispensable in enunciating the sincere flavor intentions of a dish.
I don't cook 'concepts.'
I use my head, but I cook from the heart, I cook for flavor.
UNMIK has lost control over Kosovo and its credibility too.
Only today, Harri Holkeri (the UN special representative in Kosovo) was on the television saying Serbs and Albanians want to live peacefully together.
That now sounds incredible.
The UN stands to lose whatever credibility it has left.
make imaginary puissance 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings turning th'accomplishment of many years into an hourglass.
… we are all pilgrims on the path of seeking to do God’s will in everything.
Although we differ in many ways, there are important elements of our respective faiths which can serve as a basis for fruitful dialogue and a strengthening of the spirit of tolerance and mutual help.
The USS Enterprise was the first of its kind, and for 51 years its name has been synonymous with boldness, readiness and an adventurous spirit.
Rarely has our fleet been without a ship bearing the name.
I chose to maintain this tradition not solely because of the legacy it invokes, but because the remarkable work of the name Enterprise is not done.
institutions, libraries, and museums have preserved could be given back to the world free of charge and in a new form far more universally accessible than any forms that have preceded it.
When a Loose Cannon Flogs a Dead Horse There's the Devil to Pay: Seafaring Words in Everyday Speech
Seldom does modern music so perfectly evoke a time and place in history as this terrific band.
Fans of Haden’s Liberation Music Orchestra will find the simple accessibility either surprising or disappointing, but fans of classic, romantic jazz will find joy.
These inventors of new oaths, who inanely glory in such things, and count themselves more noble for swearing thus.
This is to be seen among those who consider themselves of high breeding, or are proud.
Just as they invent and delight in everything of the nature of outward apparel, so do they also in the case of vows and oaths.
Despite having never played the violin in his life, Ed thought he might try overdubbing one himself, and Katie raced out to borrow a rather battered one from a school friend.
On May 7, a few weeks after the accident at Three-Mile Island, I was in Washington.
I was there to refute some of that propaganda that Ralph Nader, Jane Fonda and their kind are spewing to the news media in their attempt to frighten people away from nuclear power.
I am 71 years old, and I was working 20 hours a day.
The strain was too much.
The next day, I suffered a heart attack.
You might say that I was the only one whose health was affected by that reactor near Harrisburg.
No, that would be wrong.
It was not the reactor. It was Jane Fonda.
Reactors are not dangerous.
With too many disconnected sounds sharing the space, some discordant, some melodic, the resulting work lacks form and structure.
Eno and Fripp later refined the system on Evening Star and Eno's solo album Discreet Music.
We are readying up with the idea of having a new member.
We will send a delegation to study the situation and our actions will emanate from their report.
'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' took me five or ten minutes.
I did that on the guitar, which I can't play for nuts, and in one way it was quite a good thing because I was restricted, knowing only a few chords.
It's a good discipline because I simply had to write within a small framework.
I couldn't work through too many chords and because of that restriction I wrote a good song, I think.
A film that manages to be intelligent without being boring, making it one of the better music documentaries in recent memory.
The tremendous energy, finesse and sheer originality present in It's Magic, which has characterized much of Jamal's music this last decade in particular, is evidence that there is plenty of life in the old dog yet.
Well, not as good as I felt last week, but you have to come to the end of the line sometime.
beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations, and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.
I was at the rehearsal of the charming Berenice this morning, when I received an inexpressible delight.
Mr Handel is better though not well enough to play the harpsichord himself which young Smith is to do for him.
Snappy dialogue and goofy characters make this Wild Wild West soap opera in space fun and adventurous.
At that stage Please Please Me was a very dreary song It was like a Roy Orbison number, very slow, bluesy vocals.
It was obvious to me that it badly needed pepping up.
In Blade Runner, control is so powerfully and uniformly deployed that the disciplinary order and rational management of urban form have long been abandoned.
We wondered why people were so against using regular objects in their systems and concluded that it was because simple objects lacked a fancy name.
So we gave them one, and it's caught on very nicely.
If that’s the wish of the government of Iraq, we will comply with those wishes.
But no, we haven’t been approached on this issue — although obviously we stand prepared to engage the future government on any issue concerning our presence here.
They said, ‚Oh no, go right ahead.
Make it as long as you feel necessary.’
The truth of this kind of question depends on where you’re looking: on the surface or below the surface.
On the surface, Ringo was just some drummer. But there was a hell of a lot more to him than that.
For instance, there wouldn’t have been A Hard Day’s Night without him.
He had this kind of thing where he moved phrases around.
Another of his was Tomorrow never knows.
He used to say, ‘Well, tomorrow never knows’.
And he’d say it for real.
The Civil War setting is not entirely appropriate to the antics of Our Gang, and as a result General Spanky is more peculiar than funny.
"No man... can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which one may be true."
What was the use of calling us together at this time of night when he intended to retreat anyhow?!”
I believe it is of the utmost importance for us to cooperate with Europe … It is only by cooperation that we can maintain the supremacy of our western civilization … Neither they nor we are strong enough to police the earth against the opposition of the other.
In the past, we have dealt with a Europe dominated by England and France.
In the future we may have to deal with a Europe dominated by Germany.
a super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more.
Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than another internal tool.
Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company.

Nothing in Biology makes sense, except in the light of evolution.
The United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the NPT and in compliance with their nuclear nonproliferation obligations.
Nature and Nature’s Laws lay hid in Night:God said, Let Newton be! and all was Light.
Our hearts go out to the families and friends who lost loved ones and to all those who were injured.
Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy.
No words can truly express how heartbroken we are.
We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can.
We too are asking why.
We have cooperated fully with law enforcement and will continue to do so.
Like so many of you, we are saddened, but struggling to make sense of what has transpired.
Note that nobody reads every post in linux-kernel.
In fact, nobody who expects to have time left over to actually do any real kernel work will read even half.
Except Alan Cox, but he's actually not human, but about a thousand gnomes working in under-ground caves in Swansea.
None of the individual gnomes read all the postings either, they just work together really well.
Mrs. Legh is transported with joy at hearing Mr. Handel’s opera she is out of her senses.
The general lack of governmental support for Private Military Companies willing to help end armed conflicts in places like Africa, in the absence of effective international intervention, is the reason for this decision.
Without such support the ability of Sandline to make a positive difference in countries where there is widespread brutality and genocidal behaviour is materially diminished.
So hideous is the deformity caused by this habit, that it seems incredible that it should be necessary even to call attention to it, much less to urge that action be taken to put a stop to the evil.
Banjo-Kazooie follows in the footsteps of Mario 64. It doesn't stray too far from the formula, but it makes the logical progressions you would expect Nintendo to make.
Graphically, Banjo-Kazooie takes it to another level.
The game maintains the look and feel of Mario 64, but instead of flat, shaded polygons, BK uses a lot of textures.
BK may be a Mario clone, but that isn't exactly a bad thing.
In fact, it's a pretty good thing.
I am not aware of having refused to others the license which I ever claimed to myself.
And, if it please God, I shall never consent to the narrowing by a hair’s breadth that latitude of opinion which the Church has hitherto conceded to her ministers.
At the Old North Church last year, your President lit a third lantern dedicated to America’s third century of freedom and to renewed faith in the American ideals.
May its light never be dimmed.
In many ways I have drifted into this career and still have to pinch myself regularly to make sure I am not imagining it all.
my work is absolutely grounded in a certain formal approach.
These aren't drawings.
They're not paintings.
These are photographs.
I want the viewer to be aware of that.
That's why I always print full frame.
If there's a scratch on the negative, I leave it there.
The roughness in my prints is my way of letting the viewer into my process, the process of photography.
I think that photography has been considered a poor relation to fine arts for far too long.
The highest compliment you could pay a photographer is to say, "Your work is so painterly". If I wanted to paint, I would paint.
My work is about taking pictures, using a camera to observe what's out in the world.
So I present them very much as they happen in the camera: they're not matted, they're not framed, they're not cropped.
Newman stays true to the Daniel Craig-era penchant for swapping John Barry's iconic orchestral cues for loop-heavy yet appropriately moody and propulsive electronic elements that would have benefited from a lighter touch, which is surprising considering some of Newman's career highlights .
That said, the occasional tips of the hat to the past and some truly explosive and somber moments help to balance out the score's more rote passages.
When my great grandfather left here to become a cooper in East Boston, he carried nothing with him except two things: a strong religious faith and a strong desire for liberty.
I am glad to say that all of his great grandchildren have valued that inheritance.
Osamu Tezuka was happy to acknowledge the inspiration that the works of Walt Disney and his employers had on his own creations.
He even acknowledged that ‘Bambi’ assisted the creation of his lion king story.
It is reasonable and responsible of artists to be inspired by others and to study their techniques, and there is no shame in admitting so.
An individual actor A can be said to teach if it modifies its behaviour only in the presence of a naive observer, B, at some cost or at least without obtaining an immediate benefit for itself.
A’s behaviour thereby encourages or punishes B’s behaviour, or provides B with experience, or sets an example for B. As a result, B acquires knowledge or learns a skill earlier in life or more rapidly or efficiently than it might otherwise do, or that it would not learn at all.
A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force, if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

I can’t imagine that anyone who’d be willing to shell out the money for a Moon Safari 10th Anniversary Edition wouldn’t be acquainted with it already.“
An immense multitude of atoms, thus destined to pursue their never ending journey through the infinity of space, without changing their direction, or returning to the place from which they came, is a supposition very little countenanced by the usual economy of nature.
Whence is the supply of these innumerable torrents; must it not involve a perpetual exertion of creative power, infinite both in extent and in duration?
He was a superb officer in that position, hard and tough worker, and he demanded much, always insisting that anything you ask the troops to do, you must be able to do yourself.
It is absolutely necessary that God should be dead.
But I want you to know my understanding: It was good of Friedrich Nietzsche to declare God dead – I declare that he has never been born.
It is a created fiction, an invention, not a discovery.
Do you understand the difference between invention and discovery?
A discovery is about truth, an invention is manufactured by you.
It is man-manufactured fiction.
Certainly it has given consolation, but consolation is not the right thing!
Consolation is opium.
It keeps you unaware of the reality, and life is flowing past you so quickly – seventy years will be gone soon.
Anybody who gives you a belief system is your enemy, because the belief system becomes the barrier for your eyes, you cannot see the truth.
The very desire to find the truth disappears.
But in the beginning it is bitter if all your belief systems are taken away from you.
The fear and anxiety which you have been suppressing for millennia, which is there, very alive, will surface immediately.
No God can destroy it, only the search for truth and the experience of truth – not a belief – is capable of healing all your wounds, of making you a whole being.
And the whole person is the holy person to me.
Mandela has fought a good fight, and bowed out with great reverence
An information retrieval system will tend not to be used whenever it is more painful and troublesome for a customer to have information than for him not to have it.
Nirvana popularized punk, post-punk, and indie rock, unintentionally bringing it into the American mainstream like no other band before it.
Easter… was Smith's most commercial-sounding effort yet and, due to the inclusion of Springsteen's Because the Night... a Top Ten hit, it became her biggest seller...Certainly, a song that proclaimed, Love is an angel disguised as lust/Here in our bed until the morning comes, was pushing the limits of pop radio...So, Easter turned out to be the best compromise Smith achieved between her artistic and commercial aspirations.
software quality metric: A function whose inputs are software data and whose output is a single numerical value that can be interpreted as the degree to which software possesses a given attribute that affects its quality.
I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed.
It was a terrible political regime.
The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a freemarket regime designed by principled believers in a free market.
The First Army will attack at H hour on D day with the object of forcing the evacuation of the St. Mihiel Salient.
But that isn't the full reason that the war was unconscionable, and Hardcastle ignores the rest of the story. ...
What is Hardcastles point: that we should use older dudes to level Managua?
Preliminary autopsy results suggested that Mr. Kinski ‘apparently died of natural causes due to a heart problem,’ a spokeswoman for the Marin County coroner’s office said.
Let me know when you will do that and I will advertise it. For I am sure more people will come to see you jump than to hear you sing.
To be perfectly honest, I was extremely disappointed that we did not get the chance to make the next Fallout game.
This has nothing to do with Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that Fallout was ours and it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it.
It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch.
Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.
Nothing in Biology makes sense, except in the light of evolution.
And how I learned it!..
Yes, this was the most solid foundation for me.
Queen loathe the music press.
They deserve all the vitriol that may be further hurled at them if this is an accurate preview of the new album.
Journey’s End is highly recommended to those willing to search for it.
I was going to say this is a song about sex, and it is, and a song about youth and growing up, and memory, and it’s also – very much and very wonderfully – a song about singing.
Differential taxation of speakers, even members of the press, does not implicate the First Amendment unless the tax is directed at, or presents the danger of suppressing, particular ideas.
We hear that several Persons have been sent to Italy from the two Theatres, to engage some additional Voices, for the carrying on of Operas for the ensuing Season, and that Sig. Dominichino, one of the best Singers now in Italy, is engaged by Mr. Handel, and is expected over in a short time.
You can always write about social issues but who gives a damn.
I like to write about something these kids feel is their whole world.
Where there is discord, may we bring harmony.
Where there is error, may we bring truth.
Where there is doubt, may we bring faith.
And where there is despair, may we bring hope.
Men are walking over German corpses.
Corpses, hundreds and thousands of them, pave the road, lie in ditches, under the pines, in the green barley.
In some places, vehicles have to drive over the corpses, so densely they lie upon the ground A cauldron of death was boiling here, where the revenge was carried out
Let q(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then q(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
A child should be recognized as a human being when he is born -- and then, too, I have some reservations.
If a child is born blind or crippled, if a child is born deaf, dumb, and we cannot do anything....
Just because life should not be destroyed, this child will have to suffer – because of your stupid idea – for seventy years, eighty years.
Why create unnecessary suffering?
If the parents are willing, the child should be put to eternal sleep.
And there is no problem in it.
Only the body goes back into its basic elements; the soul will fly into another womb.
Nothing is destroyed.
If you really love the child, you will not want him to live a seventy-year-long life in misery, suffering, sickness, old age.
So even if a child is born, if he is not medically capable of enjoying life fully with all the senses, healthy, then it is better that he goes to eternal sleep and is born somewhere else with a better body.
It was the same with all specialists; they exagerrate the importance of whatever they are working on.
You’ve just made your first number one.
Shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only in her eyes; not as the lesser breeds of Mirkwood was their dam, and her age-old hide, knobbed and pitted with corruption but ever thickened with layer on layer within, could not be pierced by any blade of Middle-earth, not though elf or dwarf should make it and all runes were written upon it, not though the hand of Beren or of Turin wielded it.
If everyone were as well satisfied with the company as is the Royal Family, we should have to admit that there never had been such an opera since Adam and Eve sang Milton’s hymn in the Garden of Eden.
There are some dresses that transcend fashion and come to symbolise a moment.
Such was the case with the midnight blue velvet off-the-shoulder evening gown worn by Princess Diana to dance with John Travolta at a White House ball in 1985. ...
I realised all it represented: not just the late princess, but the 1980s themselves; the innocence of the decade’s materialism and the belief that everything was possible if you were armed with charm, drive and power shoulders.
The basic story structure is the same as you’ll find in 500 different slasher flicks, but just like a familiar meal always tastes good when you toss a few new spices into the mix, Cold Prey benefits from an exotic locale, a handful of unexpectedly well-drawn characters, and a very stylish directorial style.
It was meant for long-range attack and also to blind spy satellites.
Our scientists were seriously working on that.
It was designed to explode a shell in space that would have sprayed a sticky material on the satellite and blinded it.
I’m still realistic on this release: if you are not into Ulver, you won’t feel excited.
If you are into the first era-Ulver, you will feel a bit more desperate.
If you are late-era Ulver enthousiast, you probably know most of the songs.
Still worth a listen for those who are not fed up by Ulver covers, and by those who have never heard about the Uno soundtrack.
which contains such a number of capital and pleasing airs, as entitles it to one of the first places among Handel’s dramatic productions.
Until this rebellion shall have been put down, I have no friends to reward and no enemies to punish, and I trust that the whole strength and power of Vermont, both of men and of money, will be put into the field to sustain the government
I saw the Statue of Liberty.
And I said to myself, ‘Lady, you’re such a beautiful!
You opened your arms and you get all the foreigners here.
Give me a chance to prove that I am worth it, to do something, to be someone in America.’ And always that statue was on my mind.
The review of the March 2004 riots cases revealed continuing shortcomings involving prosecutors, courts and witnesses.
The Justice system failed to send a clear and strong message that ethnic violence would not be tolerated in Kosovo.
You are looking at yourselves at 180,000 miles out in space.
Dizzy Gillespie, who was nearing 72 years old at the time of this concert, headed one of his finest big bands during his later years, The United Nation Orchestra… . Whether it is "Tanga," "And Then She Stopped" or an 18-minute version of "A Night in Tunisia," every selection on this excellent CD works.
Any girl can be glamorous.
All you have to do is stand still and look stupid.
The answer to this is very simple.
It was a joke.
It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one.
Binary representations, base thirteen, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense.
I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought '42 will do'.
I typed it out.
End of story.
Video games are just now, finally, earning the validation of our parents’ generation.
We have now seen our treasured game systems go from under the Christmas trees of our youth to under glass at the Smithsonian.
It feels good.
They are autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associated as members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.
Some people think I'm an angry girl, a boy-killer, or are just plain confused by me. … My main focus this time was to not only concentrate on one musical aspect of me (I'm still funky and I love hip-hop), but to show all my colors good and bad.
Don't meddle wid t'ings yo don't understand.
We thought, if people were going to be stupid about this sort of thing, we might as well give them something to be really stupid about, you know?
Development Hell is one of those places that film-makers don't want to be in.
There's a clue in the name.
Yes, it's Hell!
Not actual fire and brimstone to be sure, but frustration, vexation, wounded egos, wasted time and money and more corporate Hollywood nonsense than you can shake a stick at.
Development Hell is where film scripts go when movie executives can't take the responsibility of giving a 'green light' to a project and part of the reason so many projects do end up in the Stygian darkness is that it's easier to say 'no' than 'yes'.
We need to be prepared for nine billion people on this planet, as we all deserve a decent and secure life.
By being creative, the world can reduce greenhouse gas emissions while creating jobs, promoting economic growth and ensuring better living standards.
Where there is a will, there is a way!
But no matter how consistent their action may have seemed to them, to the Indians it was false and absurd.
With them, as with all warlike, nomadic peoples, the decision of a majority is not regarded as binding the minority; this principle is unknown.
The Bicycle Wheel is my first Readymade, so much so that at first it wasn’t even called a ‘Readymade’.
It still had little to do with the idea of the Readymade.
Rather it had more to do with the idea of chance To set the wheel turning was very soothing, very comforting, a sort of opening of avenues on other things than material life of every day.
I liked the idea of having a bicycle wheel in my studio.
I enjoyed looking at it, just as I enjoyed looking at the flames dancing in a fireplace.
It was like having a fireplace in my studio, the movement of the wheel reminded me of the movement of the flames.
Banjo-Kazooie features the best graphics we've seen on the console, it one-ups Mario 64 in terms of gameplay, it sounds astounding and it may just be the most clever title we've ever played.
Ringo could be the best rock ’n’ roll drummer – or at least one of the best rock and roll drummers He does fills which crack up people like Jim Keltner.
He’s just amazed because Ringo starts them in the wrong place and all of that, but that is brilliance, that’s pure feel.
We refused to use backing tapes.
We refused to do any of the stuff the other bands were doing.
conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States
It’s the Roman god, Janus.
My mother gave it to me when I was little.
She wanted to teach me that people have two sides. A good side, a bad side, a past, a future.
And that we must embrace both in someone we love.
The artistic directors this year are the freelance curator Roger Buergel and his art historian wife Ruth Noack, and between them they have managed to stage the single worst art exhibition I have ever seen anywhere, ever.
Though Documenta 12 has more than 500 works, so much of what is on view is second-rate, chosen for who knows what reason and displayed so eccentrically that it is easy to overlook the few really good things in it.
This is a show organised by two pseuds and intended for graduate students and people who don’t really like visual art at all.
But the songs on it… Desire, Angel of Harlem, All I Want Is You.
There’s no mention of All I Want Is You in any of the reviews – it’s better than With or Without You.
We’ll probably have to release it as a single before people realise.
Her Majesty's Prison Service serves the public by keeping in custody those committed by the courts.
Our duty is to look after them with humanity and help them lead law-abiding and useful lives in custody and after release.
Ari has more gold in his bathroom than most governments have in their national treasuries.
I agree to carry out arduous duties with no recognition, no rewards, no promotions, and no medals
Just think how stupid the average person is, and then realize that half of ’em are stupider than that!
The bomb will not start a chain-reaction in the water converting it all to gas and letting all the ships on all the oceans drop down to the bottom.
It will not blow out the bottom of the sea and let all the water run down the hole.
It will not destroy gravity.
I am not an atomic playboy, as one of my critics labeled me, exploding these bombs to satisfy my personal whim.
Capacity fade after 600 cycles is 14.3 % at 45 °C and 25.8 % at −10 °C. The discharge pulse power capability (PPC discharge) at 45 °C does not decrease with cycling (namely,there is little power fade) from 0 to 600 cycles, whereas the power fade after 600 cyclesis 61.6 % and 77.2 %, respectively, at 0 and -10 °C. The capacity and power fade evidently becomes more severe at lower temperature due to greatly increasing cell resistance.
In particular, the power fade at low temperatures (e.g., 0 and −10 °C) rather than capacity loss is a major limitation of the LiFePO 4 cell.
A big thanks to all our wonderful fans who have supported us throughout the years.

The movie is above all about the personal codes of its heroes, both Christian and Muslim.
They are men of honor: Gentlemen, we would say, if they were only a little gentle.
They've seen enough bloodshed and lost enough comrades to look with a jaundiced eye at the zealots who urge them into battle.
There is a scene where Baldwin and Saladin meet on a vast plain between their massed troops, and agree, man to man, to end the battle right then and there.
Later, one of Balian's pre-battle speeches to his troops sounds strangely regretful: "We fight over an offense we did not give, against those who were not alive to be offended." Time for a Truth and Reconciliation Commission?
Writer and director Frank Darabont (‚The Shawshank Redemption,‘ ‚The Green Mile‘) seamlessly stitches together grand American traditions including the western, the separated-family drama and, of course, the post-apocalypse tale, creating the first zombie epic, with sprawling storylines, archetypal characters and imagery to rival ‚Gone With the Wind‘.
We have grossly underestimated mankind’s ability to find new reserves of petroleum, as well as our capacity to raise recovery rates and tap fields once thought inaccessible or impossible to produce
I have no doubt whatsoever that he would have been found guilty had it not been for DNA evidence.
That was a remarkable occurrence.
They (the Chinese) are not careful about cleanliness, and they do not wash themselves with water when they have done their necessities; but they only wipe themselves with paper.
United we stand, divided we fall.
His plane, the first helicopter, which ever worked so successfully in miniature, not only rises and descends vertically, but is able to remain stationary at any height.
German airplane experts assert that such a flight as that of Captain Lindbergh's from New York to Paris would not even be a feat for Zaschka's plane when it was perfected.
Herr Zaschka is fully aware that the perfection of his invention will be the greatest forward step in aviation since the Wright brothers made their historical hop.
As he pointed out, the danger of flying would immediately be decreased by at least 80 per cent, since four fifths of the accidents in flying occur either in the takeoff or in landing.
A motor giving thirty to forty horsepower is installed in Zaschka's present experimental machine.
It is so delicately adjusted that he has been able to keep the plane at a height of several feet above the ground, with no movement either up or down.
The object of the Photo-Secession is: To advance photography as applied to pictorial expression; To draw together those Americans practicing or otherwise interested in the art, and To hold from time to time, at varying places, exhibitions not necessarily limited to the production of the Photo-Secessionists or to American work.
And I don't think I'm ready.
Cause I don't think I see, that I believe in Jesus.
Does Jesus believe in me?
It has come to our attention that a comedic song about New Orleans in tonight’s episode of ‘The Simpsons’ has offended some city residents and officials.
Viewers who watch the episode will realize that the song is in fact a parody of the opening numbers of countless Broadway musicals, which are designed to set the stage for the story that follows.
That is the only purpose of this song.
We regret that the song, taken out of context, has caused offense.
This was certainly not the intention of ‘The Simpsons’ production staff or Fox Broadcasting Company.
When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.
There is no limit to the art of acting.
You need the understanding of all human nature, the sense of beauty of the artist and poet, the sense of rhythm of the dancer and musician, the mentality of a philosopher and scientist.
It is the universal art.
...the arm has successfully passed the test to wich it has been subjected, the minor difficulties which were experienced being only what might reasonably be expected in the case of a new gun that hat not previously been tested.
We hear that several Persons have been sent to Italy from the two Theatres, to engage some additional Voices, for the carrying on of Operas for the ensuing Season, and that Sig. Dominichino, one of the best Singers now in Italy, is engaged by Mr. Handel, and is expected over in a short time.
It is a tremendous victory in the effort to crush the Mafia.
He shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.
I AM favoured w th y rs of y e 15 th instant, & shall Endeav r to observe punctually w t you write about.
I find y t Senesino or Carestini are dersired at 1200 G s each, if they are to be had; Im’e sure that Carestini is Engaged at Milan, & has been so, for many Months past: and I hear y t Senesino, is Engaged for y e ensuing Carnival at Rome.
If Senesino is at liberty (& will accept y e offer) then the affair is adjusted if Sig ra Barbara Pisani accepts the offer I made her, which I really believe she will.
If we can neither get Senesino, nor Carestini, then M r Handel desires to have a man (Soprano) & a woman contrealt, & y t The price (for both) must not exceed one Thousand or Eleven hundred Guineas, & that the persons must sett out for London y e latter end of Aug t or beginning of Septemb r , and y t no Engagem t must be Made w th one with t a certainty of getting the other.
Several of the persons recomended to M r Handel (whose names he repeats in y e letters I received from him this Morning) are I think exceedingly indifferent, & Im’e persuaded wou’d never doe in England: & I think shou’d never be pitch’d on, till nobody else can be had.
I have heard a Lad here, of a bt 19 years old, w th a very good soprano voice (& of whom there are vast hopes) who Im’e persuaded, would do very well in London, and much better than any of those mentioned in M r Handel’s letter who are not already engaged in case you cannot get Senesino.
Having not time to answer Mr. Handel’s Letter, this day, I hope you will be so good as to let him know y t I shall Endeav r to serve him to the utmost of my power, & y t I shall do nothing but w t shall be concerted by you.
So the big names are all up there.
England has declared war to Germany on fourth of August.
There's a funny story behind the recording of that song!
I really wanted to go to Six Flags but the producers kept saying, ‘only after you finish recording!'
I sang my heart out...
I wanted to go to Six Flags so bad!
You can hear the passion in my voice!
Detroit 1-8-7 brings nothing new to the police procedural genre.
It might be supposed that the conjunction of the age’s greatest opera composer with its most successful librettist, a master of language and a fine poet to boot, would have outstandingly fruitful results.
But while all three of their joint operas contain magnificent music, none ranks with Handel’s masterpieces of 1724–25 and 1734–35 (though Poro comes near it).
The divergence of temperament was too wide.
Metastastio, as befits a cleric, wrote with an edifying purpose.
As Caesarian poet at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor for half a century, he was to dictate rules of conduct and lay down standards for public and private life and maintenance of the status quo.
Already in his early librettos moral issues are liable to take precedence over human values.
He moves his characters like pieces on a chessboard, so that they run the risk of declining into abstractions.
In all this his approach was the antithesis of Handel’s.
It is no matter for surprise that after setting three of his librettos Handel abandoned him, just as his reputation was reaching its peak of popularity, for the wilder slopes of Ariosto’s world of magic and romance.
As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.
The apparatus being arranged as shown, it will be found that when the radiations of the sun or of any other source capable of producing the effects before described fall upon the plate P an accumulation of electrical energy in the condenser C will result.
the opera; which, upon the whole, is inferior in solidity and invention to almost all his other dramatic productions, yet there are in it many proofs of genius and abilities which must strike every real judge of the art, who is acquainted with the state of dramatic Music at the time it was composed.
I discovered that rock ’n’ roll was black slang for sex.
It seemed hilarious that the whole world was dancing to this stuff, so I wrote a literal rock song.
The title was a nod to Duchamp’s Rongwrong Dada piece.
It was his first work when he arrived in New York from Europe.
Seemed appropriate.
Gates was the brilliant dreamer and creator.
I was the salesman – the go-between with father at the opportune moment.
Gates and I were father's lieutenants, each of us with a different task, but acting in perfect harmony.
Gates did the heavy thinking, and my part was to sell his ideas to father.
Of course, I was in a unique position.
I could talk with father at the strategic moment.
It might be in a relaxed mood after dinner, or while we were driving together.
Consequently I could often get his approval of ideas which others couldn't have secured because the moment wasn't right.
He invented ‚New Guitar‘ – before him no-one played or sounded like that – now everyone does.
Forget them all, from Edge onwards – they all owe it to Robin.
He was the first to use echo, distortion, flanging, delay, sustain etc as an integral part of his sound, not as an effect.
The Wabash is a nuisance to us all now.

Today we are more dedicated than ever before and as I’m basically the heart and soul of HORNA, our ideology has leaned towards Nietzsche, anti-humanity, torments, superstitions, witchcraft and even some NS ideals.
I’m quite far from telling what the whole is in just one interview but you can make your own conclusions when reading my answers.
Perhaps the best description is "Colere Chaos" - worship of chaos and ruin. . .
(… ) Your primary object will be the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial, and economic system, and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened. (… )
here are three new songs on it.
There’s some live Japanese stuff.
It’s all unreleased on CD actually, but there are some rare seven-inch stuff… not the stuff on “10 Years of Abuse”, but the stuff from the Soilent Green seven-inch and the Crippled Bastards seven-inch split.
And then the live Japanese stuff.
Some of these things strike some people as funny; others do not.
And so the audience is curiously frustrated.
It’s strange to find yourself laughing when everyone else is silent, and strange when everyone laughs and you don’t get the joke.
When the final pages of history are written, Walter Krueger will go down as the ablest Army commander of the war.
You have been a peerless soldier, you have been a great leader and you have been a great friend.
She is, I think, the outstanding animal photographer.
She is outstanding in being able to seize in her pictures some essential quality of her subjects, which more orthodox photographers are apt to miss in their desire for so-called realistic and complete representation.
I don’t want people treating me different, I don’t want people feeling bad for me, I don’t want people moping around.
I want this to be a story where when we look back, it was a happy story.

It’s the perfect way to finish the festival and a reminder that not only is St Gallen Open Air offering loads of things other events do not, it also has a line up combining the best of many worlds.
One circumstance in our route to-day cheered me greatly, and led me shortly to expect some important and decisive change in the character and formation of the country.
It was the appearance for the first time of the Banksia, a shrub which I had never before found to the westward of Spencer’s Gulf, but which I knew to abound in the vicinity of King George’s Sound, and that description of country generally.
Those only who have looked out with the eagerness and anxiety of a person in my situation, to note any change in the vegetation or physical appearance of a country, can appreciate the degree of satisfaction with which I recognised and welcomed the first appearance of the Banksia.
Isolated as it was amidst the scrub, and insignificant as the stunted specimens were that I first met with, they led to an inference that I could not be mistaken in, and added, in a tenfold degree, to the interest and expectation with which every mile of our route had now become invested.
Do you mind if I make this book a little bit longer, because I think there’s a need for explaining these things in somewhat more detail.
I go on and jump, give it a try Checking the parachute, see if it flies. Oh if I should break my neck I never bruise… I go on and just, give it a try Don’t call the ambulance, I’m still alive And if I should break my neck I’ll make the news.
Using a free version of vi is not a sin; it is a penance.
I am winding down Irrational Games as you know it.
I’ll be starting a smaller, more entrepreneurial endeavor at Take-Two.
But, like most hangovers, In Flight just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
Dave and I were screwing around on a 4-track, and I wrote that song in about thirty seconds.
And I sat down for like half-an-hour and wrote the lyrics and then we recorded it.
no outside influence could solve the problems of European nations, or bring them lasting peace.
They must work out their destiny, as we must work out ours.
We’re beginning with the four direct-to-DVD feature releases, and then down the road, each of them will appear as an epic four-episode arc on Comedy Central.
There are a few things on the DVD that we won’t have on the show, and a couple of things on the show that won’t be on the DVD, because it’ll be for TV.
Offically it has to be justified to the budgetiers as a military program.
So they had to invent fake military requirements for it.
He sees the good in everybody.
He's never talked about wanting to be a millionaire.
He lives to make the music he wants to make.
I hated it.
And it made me really uncomfortable and it was very much like a sport, and I was interested in poetry in large part because it was like the antithesis of sports It seemed to me like a very macho, masculine form of poetry and not at all what I was interested in.
We are very pleased to be able to get access to the technical information necessary to continue to develop Samba as a Free Software project.
Although we were disappointed the decision did not address the issue of patent claims over the protocols, it was a great achievement for the European Commission and for enforcement of antitrust laws in Europe.
The agreement allows us to keep Samba up to date with recent changes in Microsoft Windows, and also helps other Free Software projects that need to interoperate with Windows.
I worked with Brian Fargo at Interplay for a number of years and we both left Interplay at the same time.
We knew we wanted to stay in video games When we were first out there, trying to figure out what to do next, we kinda felt like we were in exile, and we made fake cards with a fake company name just to have a card to go to E3 with.
And before we ever thought of the name ‘inXile,’ Brian put as his job description on the cards: ‘Leader in exile.’
To defend the existence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the state of Israel. To protect the inhabitants of Israel and to combat all forms of terrorism which threaten the daily life.
I wanted to do something more exciting and interesting than the traditional club video.
The directors come in, and guys present treatments to me, and they aren’t my usual video directors, and we came up with a concept for it, just a little more futuristic.
I took a scene that I seen in a Will Smith film, I Am Legend… It’s a collage that I thought was interesting.
I even tried to give My Sweet Lord away to get the thing settled – just let’em have it; it doesn’t matter to me.
I’ve never had any money from it – it’s always been in escrow – and as far as I’m concerned the effect the song has had far exceeds any bitching that’s been going on between copyright people; it’s just greed and jealousy and all that.
Give them the song – I don’t care.
But my lawyers said: ‘Oh no you can’t do that; it’s impossible… ’. So, it drags on but it’s certainly not giving me sleepless nights.
One typical night of testing, the Navy sub-hunter airplanes made fiftyseven passes at us and detected the ship only twice — both times at a mile-and-a-half distance, so that we would have shot them down easily long before they spotted us.
Several times, we actually provided the exact location to the pilots and they still could not pick us up on their radar.
As far as a first episode goes, Kentucky Route Zero establishes the setting, tone and characters better than I could have expected.
I love that I’m still thinking about what exactly happened to Conway and company, and that intrigue has left me longing for the next piece of the tale.
His portraits of half-clad athletes caught in mid-action became a vehicle for his extraordinary understanding of anatomy.
Civilization is not to kill human beings, not to destroy things, not to make war; civilization is to hold mutual affection and to respect one another.
is the most agreeable song of execution of the times.
I have been told that the brilliancy of her voice made its way through the busy accompaniment of this song in a manner which filled the whole theatre.
A close in this air appears for the first time, which has since become fashionable, as well as the return to the subject in the Da Capo.
In every respect, Descent to Undermountain was deemed a failure, and Interplay quickly tried to forget it.
Rowland sees life as a contest in which opponents may have to be kneed in the groin now and then. He also had a strong devious and manipulative streak.
His character was well summed up in a Department of Trade enquiry which concluded that he had ’vision, negotiating ability, determination and personality in unusual measure with unbounded energy to apply his talents’. But he was also a ‘dominating personality, an able negotiator with a record of success, and if he does not want to discuss a particular topic he has an infinite capacity to talk around the subject.’
Based on first of internationally popular Perry Rhodan series of novels, but worthless nonetheless.
But we only had one or two meetings, maximum, with them and the producer, Al Brodax – basically there was very little involvement from us.
How on Earth could I, a junior analyst, possibly believe I could change the world for the better over those with the proper authority?
I know that I can and will be a better person.
I hope that you can give me the opportunity to prove, not through words but through conduct, that I can return to a productive place in society.
Brodax got half of Yellow Submarine out of my mouth.
The idea for the Hoover, the machine that sucks people up – all those were my ideas.
They used to come to the studio and chat: ‘Hi, John, old bean.
Got any ideas for the film?’ And I’d just spout out all this stuff, and they went off and did it.
this album captures all the sweat, fire, and angry joy that was lost in the thin, disembodied recording of the band's debut, and the Pogues sound stronger and tighter without losing a bit of their edge in the process. (… ) Rum Sodomy & the Lash falls just a bit short of being the Pogues best album, but was the first one to prove that they were a great band, and not just a great idea for a band.
Among the remedies which it has pleased Almighty God to give to man to relieve his sufferings, none is so universal and so efficacious as opium.
Major-General Harold Alexander inspected the shores of Dunkirk from a motorboat this morning to make sure no-one was left behind before boarding the last ship back to Britain.
that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful!
To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem.
In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remark’d, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary ways of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surpriz’d to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not.
This change is imperceptible; but is however, of the last consequence.
For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis necessary that it shou’d be observ’d and explain’d; and at the same time that a reason should be given; for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it... am persuaded, that a small attention wou’d subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceiv’d by reason.
His music will live on forever, as will his personality.
We had just so many beautiful times together and that is what I am going to remember him by.
He was just my baby brother and he will sorely missed.
I understand the end was a very peaceful, golden moment – that’s a blessing.
the dichotomy between the archaic and the progressive.
Half Taking Tiger Mountain – that Middle Ages physical feel of storming a military position – and half (By Strategy) – that very, very 20th-century mental concept of a tactical interaction of systems
Banks tells me that he has spent the past three months writing another Culture novel.
It will be called Matter and is to be published next February. ’It's a real shelf-breaker,’ he says enthusiastically. ’It's 204,000 words long and the last 4,000 consist of appendices and glossaries.
It's so complicated that even in its complexity it's complex.
I'm not sure the publishers will go for the appendices, but readers will need them.
It's filled with neologisms and characters who disappear for 150 pages and come back, with lots of flashbacks and -forwards.
And the story involves different civilisations at different stages of technological evolution.
There's even one group who have disappeared up their own fundaments into non-matter-based societies.’
Do you want the provisions of the Scotland Act 1978 to be put into effect?
Slender Rising is excellent.
It’s dead scary and it adds a lot of smart, welcome new ideas to the original game.
A source, however, is the version which the storyteller uses to recreate the story in his own words.
I hope to show that ‘Aotrou and Itroun’ had a definite source which Tolkien consulted, and also that he was aware of the tale’s many analogues throughout Europe.

Carry it throughout the world as a symbol of Christ’s love for humanity, and announce to everyone that only in the death and resurrection of Christ can we find salvation and redemption.
Whatever you said about the Tsarist Russian army might give you trouble.
If you wrote in a positive, patriotic way about it, you might offend against the Communist orthodoxy, by which everything Tsarist was condemned.
If, on the other hand, you concentrated on the negative side, you could offend against the nationalist line which emerged with Stalin and which flourished under Brezhnev.
Even the obvious sources were quite difficult to obtain; I was told, some years later, that The Eastern Front was listed in a German catalogue, but could not be read without permission. the subject was still, in the seventies, taboo.

They were monstrous things and extremely heavy, but the machinery of the guns was very simple and that's why they did so extremely well and didn't give nearly as much trouble as some of the more complicated guns that came to appear later on.
One was the very first to be made and it was marked, 'Eight-inch Howitzer No. 1 Mark I' so we called that gun, 'The Original'.
It was marvellously accurate.
When the country is facing an international crisis, such expressions impose a heavy burden on the country’s political, security and economic interests.
There were about 400 of us who took part in the operation.
I was part of the leadership council.
When the US allowed the Shah to enter America for medical reasons, we were convinced they were plotting against us.
So, we wanted to send a message.
We intended to detain the diplomats for a few days, maybe one week, but no more.
After we took over the embassy, Iranians from all over the city streamed into the area and chanted anti-American slogans.
The events took on a life of their own.
When the Imam blessed the takeover, there was no turning back.
The team had the authority to kill Osama bin Laden unless he offered to surrender, in which case the team was required to accept his surrender, if the team could do so safely.
The operation was conducted in a manner fully consistent with the laws of war.
The operation was planned so that the team was prepared and had the means to take Bin Laden into custody. There is simply no question that this operation was lawful.
Bin Laden was the head of Al Qaeda, the organization that conducted the attacks of September 11, 2001, and Al Qaeda and Bin Laden himself had continued to plot attacks against the United States.
We acted in the nation’s self defense.
The operation was conducted in a way designed to minimize and avoid altogether if possible civilian casualties.
And if I might add, that was done at great risk to Americans.
Considering the state of home video-game technology in 1981, Utopia is an astonishingly detailed simulation.

First of all, I had worked out the arrangement long before Robert came to my house and secondly, Robert didn’t even play the flippin’ guitar in those days!!
Thirdly, I didn’t ask him if he could imagine playing that song, I TOLD him that I wanted to do it.
...with the appearance of Erdenklang by Bognermayr and Zuschrader the medium of electronic music has crossed another threshold. To me it has been a long tedious way for this to happen...
Dawn of the Dead is one of the best horror films ever made – and, as an inescapable result, one of the most horrifying.
It is gruesome, sickening, disgusting, violent, brutal and appalling.
It is also (excuse me for a second while I find my other list) brilliantly crafted, funny, droll, and savagely merciless in its satiric view of the American consumer society.
Nobody ever said art had to be in good taste.
Cuzzoni had been publicly told she was to be hissed off the stage on Tuesday; she was in such concern at this, that she had a great mind not to sing, but I positively ordered her not to quit the stage, but let them do what they would and she owns now that if she had not that order she would have quitted the stage when they cat-called her to such a degree in one song, that she was not heard one note, which provoked the people that liked her so much, that they were not able to get the better of their resentment, but would not suffer the Faustina to speak afterwards.
We all thought it was the best album.
Significantly, it was also the one with the weakest sales.
We were confident it was going to be bigger than anything The Beatles had done.
But, there was no single.
The record died on us.
A pass is this little book you must get when you are 16 and it says where you can work, and where you can be, and if you have got work.
You can’t get a job without this book.
And you can only get a job where they stamp your pass to say ‘Johannesburg’ or ‘Pretoria’ and so on.
You must carry it with you all the time because the police can ask you, ‘Where is your pass?’ any time, and then you must show them.
If you haven’t got your pass, they put you in jail for some days or else you must pay some money to get out.
My education only began the day I arrived in England.
People were so kind and decent, they didn’t see an enemy prisoner, they saw a human being.
The British made me what I am I come back four or five times a year and always think: Great, I’m home.
Any time, any time while I was a slave, if one minute's freedom had been offered to me, and I had been told I must die at the end of that minute, I would have taken it — just to stand one minute on God's airth a free woman — I would.

An experimental confirmation of a previously known fact is, of course, always welcome, although its importance can, in this case, not be considered of the significance that it is worthy of the Nobel Prize.
When I was a kid, I was playing baseball with my brother in the backyard.
He hit a fly ball that landed in front of my neighbors’ bedroom window.
The neighbors were Mr. & Mrs. Gorsky.
As I leaned down to pick up the ball, I heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky, ‘Oral sex!
Oral sex you want?
You’ll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon!’

Shipping first time code is like going into debt.
A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite… The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid.
Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt.
Entire engineering organizations can be brought to a stand-still under the debt load of an unconsolidated implementation, object-oriented or otherwise.
In the Disney World, the menstrual flow is not blood red but snow white.
The vaginal drawings look more like a cross section of as kitchen sink than the outside and inside of a woman’s body.
There are no hymen, no clitoris, no labia; all focus is on the little nest and its potentially lush lining.
Although Disney and Kimberly-Clark advise exercise during the period, the exercising cartoon Girls (who look like Disney’s Cinderella) are drawn without feet; bicycles magically propel themselves down the street without any muscular or mental direction from the cyclist.
The film ends happily ever after, with a shot of a lipsticked bride followed immediately by a shot of a lipsticked mother and baby.
Davis' pure-toned solos and the conversational banter that occurs with Coltrane, and later Garland during When the Lights Are Low, resound as some of these musicians' finest moments.
When I started playing guitar, I created standard thrash/heavy metal, and I looked for a band after having created a couple of songs.
One day, I heard the song "Funeral Procession" by Gorgoroth, and I was completely blown away.
The use of minor and major chords in this song is really amazing, and I found out that I wanted to create music with the same type of chord progressions.
All of the thrash ideas were thrown in the thrash can, and my new inspiration resulted in the sound of Sworn as you know it today.
It doesn't sound much like Gorgoroth though. I feel that I've found my own way of composing music – mainly mixing melodic black metal elements with heavy metal riffs and rhythms.
I began to feel that I had been spending so much time exploring the upper atmosphere of music and the more ethereal kind of far-out spacey stuff.
Now there was this need to take some more of the earth and to feel a little more tethered; a connection to the earth...I was beginning to feel that we (the sextet) were playing this heavy kind of music, and I was tired of everything being heavy.
I wanted to play something lighter.
I write with my heart, and if something sounds to boring or normal, I’ll just change the metaphors around until it sounds cool.

Samaranch was offered a choice: he could either be compromised through the publication of articles in the Soviet and foreign press detailing his activities, which would undoubtedly have put an end to his diplomatic career, or he could collaborate with the KGB as a secret agent.
Samaranch chose the latter option.
On the original version John left a hole in the song for an instrumental section, and while he was away having dinner I recorded a keyboard solo like a Bach two part invention.
He loved it, and it has remained an integral part of the song ever since.
Sometime next year there might be a new record, but only if things work out.
Should any party attempt to abolish social security and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history.
There is a tiny splinter group of course, that believes you can do these things ...
Their number is negligible and they are stupid.
to get back to the haircut.
I should know!
We saw a guy in Hamburg, whose hair we liked.
John and I were hitchhiking to Paris.
We asked him to cut our hair like he did his.
He was living in Paris.
He was sort of an artsy guy, a photographer friend of everyone.
His name was Jürgen.
He could break your heart with a look.
The movie traveled to the moon every time he came onto the screen.
Nobody could hold a candle to him.
He was just there, didn’t have to say hello or goodbye.
We are not only fighting armies, but a hostile people, and must make old and young, rich and poor, feel the hard hand of war, as well as their organized armies.
I know that this recent movement of mine through Georgia has had a wonderful effect in this respect.
Thousands who had been deceived by their lying papers into the belief that we were being whipped all the time, realized the truth, and have no appetite for a repetition of the same experience.
If you thought Total Eclipse was a poor game, I'd agree with you.
The sequel, however, had quite a bit more going for it.
First, the gameplay is actually fast-paced and exciting.
There is actually technique to use when dodging enemies and obstacles.
The graphics may not be the most spectacular, but they get the job done.
There are a lot of nice little details.
The power-ups are really intense, but they do get distracting.
This ranks among the best for the Saturn.
due to BK's many tight, enclosed areas, the camera sometimes fails to show the action from a playable perspective. Expect to miss some things that would normally be incredibly obvious, due to a bad angle.
Also, you'll have to control the camera a bit more than you should have to, as it doesn't track perfectly.

Rajiv Menon's second directorial venture Kandukondain Kandukondain, premiered on May 4th at Devi theatre in Chennai, succeeds in both style and substance.

Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.
Every system is somebody's subsystem.
"Fallen Leaves" is a punk rocker that is instantly reminiscent of Green Day, right down to Benjamin Kowalewicz's shouted vocals.
Catchy without being thrilling, the chorus is designed for fist-pumping moshpits, but the song lacks substance and is easily disposable as soon as the last chords end.
… it was agreed, that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural, or at least romantic, yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith.
I’m much better now.
But truthfully I don’t like talking about it.
It was something that was meant to be private, and even though it isn’t anymore, I’d still like to keep it as private as I can.
It was very traumatic, and I am extremely upset it happened.
I hope all my fans can learn from my mistake and make smart decisions.
But I wouldn’t have been able to get through it if it wasn’t for my family, friends, and fans, who supported me all along the way.

In the unlikely event that Zhukov was correct and Mars was really a diversion, there has never been one so ambitious, so large, so clumsily executed, or so costly.
We'll play a song through and record it, listen to it and decide what could make it even better — repeat a chorus, simple rearrangement, we all spark off of each other.
Some of the new songs have really great moments — we want to make the entire song a really great moment.
Servants of God, we will desecrate your coward race with darkness.
Don't leave anything behind worth more than five dollars.
A fine remake that addresses any and all issues the first version had.
A lot of the Jews are great friends of mine, they swarm around me and are friendly to me because they know that I'm friendly with Israel.
But they don't know how I really feel about what they are doing to this country.
And I have no power, no way to handle them, but I would stand up if under proper circumstances.
Around the time of writing While My Guitar Gently Weeps I had a copy of the ‚I Ching – the (Chinese) Book of Changes‘ which seemed to me to be based on the Eastern concept that everything is relative to everything else, as opposed to the Western view that things are merely coincidental.This idea was in my head when I visited my parents’ house in the North of England.
I decided to write a song based on the first thing I saw upon opening any book – as it would be relative to that moment at that time.
I picked up a book at random – opened it – saw ‚Gently weeps‘ – then laid the book down again and started the song.
Something of a happy accident, this recording from the 1969 Montreux Jazz Festival has actually become one of the most talked about, exhilarating and fun live jazz performances ever captured on wax.
Dorothy Mackaill and Don Cook are the unhappy lovers.
Nina Mae McKinney, the too seldom seen temptress of "Hallelujah," as a dark-skinned barmaid, is about the most entertaining item in the film.
May I extend a warm welcome to all the athletes and officials.
I am sure that they will compete and participate in the true Olympic spirit of cooperation, understanding and friendship without any political influence.
Nevertheless, our thoughts also go to those athletes who have not been able to join us.
In 1953, a memorial tower was built on the site to commemorate the Serbian victims.

From Guildford comes a strange but well-attested Piece of News.
That a poor Woman who lives at Godalmin, near that Town, was about a Month past delivered by Mr John Howard, an Eminent Surgeon and Man-Midwife, of a creature resembling a Rabbit but whose Heart and Lungs grew without its Belly, about 14 Days since she was delivered by the same Person, of a perfect Rabbit: and in a few Days after of 4 more; and on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, the 4th, 5th, and 6th instant, of one in each day: in all nine, they died all in bringing into the World.

People after all, differ much in their Opinion about this Matter, some looking upon them as great Curiosities, fit to be presented to the Royal Society, etc. others are angry at the Account, and say, that if it be a Fact, a Veil should be drawn over it, as an Imperfection in human Nature.

… austere and puritanical souls regard … as an inevitable and a desirable nemesis on so much ‘overexpansion’ as they call it … It would, they feel, be a victory for the mammon of unrighteousness if so much prosperity was not subsequently balanced by universal bankruptcy.
We need, they say, what they politely call a ‘prolonged liquidation’ to put us right.
The liquidation, they tell us, is not yet complete.
But in time it will be.
And when sufficient time has elapsed for the completion of the liquidation, all will be well with us again…
Thy time is not thine own – it needs must be devoted to the great work of our Order.

Proper time for prayer mayst be taken at dawn, at noon, at eventide, and at night.
It wasn't until some time after the game was in development that I decided to call it ‘real-time strategy’– it seems obvious now, but there was a lot of back and forth between calling it a ‘real-time war game’, ‘real-time war’, ‘wargame’, or ‘strategy game’.
I was deeply concerned that words like ‘strategy’ and ‘wargame’ would keep many players from even trying this completely new game dynamic.
Before 1992, wargames and strategy games were very much niche markets – with the exception of Sid Meier's work – so my fears were justified.
But in the end, it was best to call it an ‘RTS’ because that is exactly what it was.

‘If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.’ Johnson, supra, at 414.
You're like a dog chasing a car.
You'll never catch it and you just wouldn't know what to do with it if you did.
If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man sitting in his own house what books he may read or what films he may watch.
Scots and Huns were fraternizing in the most genuine possible manner.
Every sort of souvenir was exchanged, addresses given and received, photos of families shown, etc.
One of our fellows offered a German a cigarette; the German said, ‘Virginian?’
Our fellow said, ‘Aye, straight-cut’, the German said ‘No thanks, I only smoke Turkish!’ It gave us all a good laugh.
Suppose you see a bird walking around in a farm yard.
This bird has no label that says ‘duck’.
But the bird certainly looks like a duck.
Also, he goes to the pond and you notice that he swims like a duck.
Then he opens his beak and quacks like a duck. Well, by this time you have probably reached the conclusion that the bird is a duck, whether he’s wearing a label or not.

My dear, invaluable friend, ...believe me, my heart entertains the very warmest affection for you, and it has been no fault of mine, and not a little mortification, that you have not the red ribbon and other rewards that would have kept you afloat; but as I trust the war is at an end, you must take your flag when it comes to you, for who is to command our fleets in a future war?...I pity the poor Maltese; they have sustained an irreparable loss in your friendly counsel and an able director in their public concerns; you were truly their father, and, I agree with you, they may not like stepfathers....
Believe me at all times and places, for ever your sincere, affectionate, and faithful friend.
Schaefer was the master of the carom game of billiards, with the most delicate stroke in the world, using either hand, he would execute a difficult mass shot that would bring an applauding audience to their feet.

For sheer numbness of purpose, nothing beats ‚Angel of Death,‘ Slayer's commentary on Nazi Joseph Mengele.
Mengele was a ‚sadist of the noblest blood‘ who ‚toiled to benefit the Aryan race‘ by performing ‚surgery with no anesthesia.‘ Jeez, if you ever wondered what effect Hogan's Heroes had on our culture, this is it – a view of the Holocaust as comic-book drama, as removed from reality as the Black Plague or Darth Vader.

the aria ‘Ch’io parta?’ is one of the line of ‘otherwordly’ slow movements in E major that lead to ‘I Know that my Redeemer liveth’.
It was a key in which Handel found a fatalistic quality, and Burney admits that this aria has ‘no fault but brevity’.
There’s a cheap thrill in watching Hudson defuse Cook’s pig antics with some foulness of her own.

Vocally, The Manhattan Transfer is one of the slickest group’s on today’s market.
Their intro number, Tuxedo Junction, is a precise recreation of the 1940 Glenn Miller oldie, with the group’s four part vocal harmonies and jazz riffs supplanting the Miller instrumentals.
They have done their homework; they have studied their old 78s in detail.
In the honors section, Blue Champagne, a Dorsey beauty, and Candy evoke all of the magic and hazy charm of the 30’s and 40’s.
Belus is exactly what a "comeback" album should be in black metal: not a shallow (but basically very good) rock album like Gorgoroth's Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt and not achingly banal and redundant like Beherit's Engram, but feral, pure in vision, desolate, hauntingly familiar, yet new.
As the title suggests, Joshua Redman explores new rhythmic territory on Freedom in the Groove.
Abandoning the traditional hard bop that has dominated his past recordings, Redman attempts to work himself into hip-hop and urban dance rhythms, which results in an occasionally intriguing but often frustrating Album...Too often, the record sounds forced and stilted, which is unfortunate, since jazz/hip-hop fusion need a musician of Redman's caliber to make it credible in the jazz world.
one of the most powerful, horrible, yet fascinating pictures that has been painted anywhere in this century… but the more one praises it, the more one must condemn its admission to a gallery where men and women of weak nerves must be compelled to look at it, for not to look at it is impossible.
It is a very interesting result of recent discoveries that the machinery which Le Sage introduced for the purpose of his theory has a very close analogy with things for which we have now direct experimental evidence Röntgen rays, however, when absorbed do not, as far as we know, give rise to more penetrating Rontgen rays as they should to explain attraction, but either to less penetrating rays or to rays of the same kind.

I believe that the Courtois-Pieprzyk work is flawed. They overcount the number of linearly independent equations.
